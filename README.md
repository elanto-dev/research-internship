# requirements.txt file

Due to the issues related to **pycld2** library failing to install on Windows 11 machine, the wheel file (.whl) was used to directly install the library in the environment. The wheel file is included with this repository for Python 3.9, however, *requirements.txt* file contains absolute path that should be replaced on the different machine.
