        "Please analyse the text below to find the root causes for the literacy gap, only provide analysis from the text that is directly related to the literacy gap and it's root causes.\nImproving Literacy as a Means to Reducing Health Disparities\nSomnath Saha, MD, MPH\nAuthor information Copyright and License information PMC Disclaimer\nRacial and socioeconomic disparities in morbidity and mortality have been apparent virtually as long as health statistics have been collected. In the United States, African Americans in particular fare worse than the majority population on nearly all measures of health, including infant mortality; life expectancy; cancer, heart disease, stroke, and trauma incidence and mortality; and self-rated health status.1 Individuals with low levels of educational attainment and income also tend to experience higher rates of illness and death, independent of race.2\u20134 Over the past several decades, though the U.S. population as a whole has enjoyed substantial declines in morbidity and mortality\u2014largely due to better living conditions, public health measures, and advances in medical care\u2014racial and socioeconomic disparities have persisted or even widened.1,5\nEliminating these disparities has become a national priority. It is 1 of the 2 primary objectives of the nation's public health agenda6 and is the central focus of the recently established National Center for Minority Health and Health Disparities within the National Institutes of Health. Progress, however, has been slow. Most importantly, our understanding of the causes of health disparities remains limited. Race and socioeconomic status (SES) cannot themselves be thought of as causes. Both are composite concepts whose meanings are, in and of themselves, elusive. Race was originally formulated as a way of distinguishing human subpopulations with supposedly different genetic origins.7 Intermarriage and globalization and the findings of cross-national and genomic studies, however, have all diminished the likelihood that genetic differences account for the majority of the observed racial disparities in health. More likely, these disparities are due to social determinants.\nRace and SES are defining characteristics in our society. They segregate us into separate spheres and influence our opportunities and experiences. As such, they help determine our access to financial resources, our position in social hierarchies, the cultural lens through which we view the world, and the way we are treated by others (Fig. 1). Altering these aspects of race and SES will require major social and political change, which, in our incrementally oriented system, seems unlikely to occur in the near future. It is useful, then, to look at how these social implications of race and ethnicity affect health outcomes. A growing body of research suggests several \u201cproximate\u201d causes, i.e., those that directly result in differential morbidity and mortality: cumulative stress (or \u201callostatic load\u201d), access to medical care, environmental exposures, and health behaviors.8,9 Reducing the impact of race and SES on these proximate causal factors may be the key to reducing and eliminating health disparities. It is critical, then, to understand the pathways between the root and proximate causes of health disparities. For instance, while it is fairly obvious how limited financial resources restrict access to medical care, it is less clear why race is associated with limited access independent of income and health insurance coverage. Likewise, how lower social position and greater social inequality contribute to psychological stress is not well understood. Some research has pointed to self-efficacy and locus of control as potentially important mediating factors.10 Social and community support may also play a role. Intuitively, a more \u201cculturally competent\u201d health care system and health and social policies aimed at greater social justice might improve matters as well.\nAn external file that holds a picture, illustration, etc.\nObject name is jgi0021-0893-f1.jpg\nPotential pathways mediating the effects of race and socioeconomic status on health\nSeveral articles in this issue of JGIM suggest that enhancing health literacy may be another important pathway to reducing health disparities. Studying a population of community-dwelling elders, Sudore et al.11 found that low literacy was associated with higher mortality. They also found that African Americans, individuals with less than a high-school education, and people with low income had higher mortality and were much more likely than others to have low literacy. Although their analyses did not directly address whether accounting for literacy reduced the associations of race and SES with mortality, back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that African Americans with adequate literacy had mortality rates similar to whites. The same appears true for people with low education and income levels. In 2 other studies, Howard et al.12 and Sentell and Halpin13 directly examined low literacy as a possible mediator of health disparities. Both groups found that disparities in health status by both race and educational attainment were attenuated and in some cases eliminated after accounting for literacy. The robustness of all of these findings is amplified by the fact that the 3 studies included populations across a wide age range and each used a different instrument to measure literacy.\nThese findings raise the alluring possibility that improving literacy may be an effective mechanism to reduce health disparities. Alluring because low literacy may be remediable through simple interventions rather than radical social change. The promise of improving literacy as a means to reducing health disparities, however, depends on 2 important assumptions. The first assumption is that literacy is causally related to reduced disparities and not simply a marker of other causal pathways. Low literacy may cause health disparities through a variety of mechanisms. Low health literacy in particular, almost by definition, may reduce the accessibility and effectiveness of medical care, resulting in worse health outcomes. Interestingly, however, Sudore et al.11 found that accounting for access to care did not explain the effect of low literacy on mortality. Similarly, Howard et al. found that differences in literacy helped explain racial disparities in self-reported health status but not in vaccination rates. Moreover, other studies in this issue question the common assumption that low literacy contributes to poor medication adherence.14,15 In short, none of the studies support the notion that medical care mediates the association between literacy and health disparities. It should be noted, though, that in measuring facets of medical care, these studies may not have captured the more complex aspects of health system navigation, interpersonal negotiation, and illness management where literacy may have the greatest impact.\nHow else might literacy be related to health disparities? It is possible that by increasing the challenges of navigating through daily life, low literacy increases individuals' stress burden. It may also reduce the likelihood that individuals are adequately informed and activated with regard to healthy behaviors. Finally, low literacy may diminish an individual's self-efficacy, i.e., the ability to exert control over one's life and surroundings. Sudore et al.11 addressed most of these potential pathways by adjusting for variables intended to capture them and found that none of them helped explain the effect of literacy on mortality. Again, it is possible that the variables used were inadequate measures of stress, behaviors, and self-efficacy, but the findings still raise the question of whether literacy is causally related to health outcomes or is merely a marker for some other unmeasured factor.\nThe second assumption needed for the promise of improving literacy as a way to reduce health disparities to be realized is that the meaning and impact of literacy are similar across racial and socioeconomic groups. As discussed in the Perspective by Baker16 in this issue, literacy and the ways in which it affects health are complex. They are intricately linked to culture and language, facets of life that may vary widely among different racial and socioeconomic groups. It is possible, for instance, that some minority Americans with low literacy levels are less assimilated than others into mainstream (white) society and suffer poorer health due to higher stress levels from interracial conflict or anxiety or due to less engagement in mainstream health care institutions and practices. Intervening to improve the literacy levels of such individuals may have little or no effect on their health if they continue to feel culturally disengaged from the health care system or from people of other racial, ethnic, or socioeconomic groups.\nAnother important issue when considering literacy among different populations is that different aspects of literacy may be more or less relevant for different cultural groups. Most studies use individuals' capacity to read print materials as a proxy for the broader and more complex construct of literacy. In some cultures, oral communication may be much more important than written, and the ability to read may be less relevant to self-efficacy and health. It is notable that Mexican immigrants to the United States generally have better health profiles than white Americans, despite lower literacy levels in general, and much lower English-language literacy levels. Moreover, second- and third-generation Mexican Americans tend to be less healthy than their first-generation counterparts, despite greater English proficiency and presumably higher literacy levels.17 Clearly, literacy cannot be thought of as a \u201cmagic bullet.\u201d\nThese caveats notwithstanding, the evidence that improving literacy may be an effective means to reduce racial and socioeconomic disparities in health is sufficiently suggestive that interventions should be undertaken to test this hypothesis. Such trials will be the only way to definitively determine whether literacy is a mediator of racial and socioeconomic disparities in health or merely a marker of other causal factors. The most promising interventions will be among patients with complex chronic illnesses, such as diabetes, where literacy and its potential impact on self-efficacy and health behaviors are most likely to have a positive effect.18 Outcomes that could be feasibly measured in a reasonable time frame would include intermediate measures such as glycohemoglobin levels and blood pressure, as well as functional status and health-related quality of life. In designing interventions, it is critical to remember that improving health literacy can be achieved not only by affording new skills to patients but also by reducing the literacy demand, or complexity, of health-related information.\nHealth inequalities are among the most pressing concerns for our profession and for the nation as a whole. We still have much to learn about the pathways we might use to reduce and eventually eliminate these disparities. One such pathway, however, seems promising enough that it warrants investment of our efforts and funding. It is time for studies of improving literacy as a means to reduce racial and socioeconomic disparities in health.\nYour JSON output:"

The best\nperforming models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention\nmechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer,\nbased solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions\nentirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to\nbe superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly\nless time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 Englishto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including\nensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task,\nour model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.0 after\ntraining for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the\nbest models from the literature.\nRecurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [12] and gated recurrent [7] neural networks\nin particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and\ntransduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [29, 2, 5]. Numerous\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\n\u2217Equal contribution. Listing order is random. Jakob proposed replacing RNNs with self-attention and started\nthe effort to evaluate this idea. Ashish, with Illia, designed and implemented the first Transformer models and\nhas been crucially involved in every aspect of this work. Noam proposed scaled dot-product attention, multi-head\nattention and the parameter-free position representation and became the other person involved in nearly every\ndetail. Niki designed, implemented, tuned and evaluated countless model variants in our original codebase and\ntensor2tensor. Llion also experimented with novel model variants, was responsible for our initial codebase, and\nefficient inference and visualizations. Lukasz and Aidan spent countless long days designing various parts of and\nimplementing tensor2tensor, replacing our earlier codebase, greatly improving results and massively accelerating\nour research.\n\u2020Work performed while at Google Brain.\n\u2021Work performed while at Google Research.\n31st Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS 2017), Long Beach, CA, USA.\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht\u22121 and the input for position t. This inherently\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [18] and conditional\ncomputation [26], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduction models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\nthe input or output sequences [2, 16]. In all but a few cases [22], however, such attention mechanisms\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\n[20], ByteNet [15] and ConvS2S [8], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [11]. In the Transformer this is\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\ndescribed in section 3.2.\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 22, 23, 19].\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequencealigned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\nlanguage modeling tasks [28].\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequencealigned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [14, 15] and [8].\n3 Model Architecture\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 29].\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., xn) to a sequence\nof continuous representations z = (z1, ..., zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\nsequence (y1, ..., ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\n[9], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\nconnected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,\n3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks\nEncoder: The encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. Each layer has two\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position2\nFigure 1: The Transformer - model architecture.\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [10] around each of\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\npredictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\n3.2 Attention\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum\nof the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the\nquery with the corresponding key.\n3.2.1 Scaled Dot-Product Attention\nWe call our particular attention \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\" (Figure 2). The input consists of\nqueries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the\nScaled Dot-Product Attention Multi-Head Attention\nFigure 2: (left) Scaled Dot-Product Attention. (right) Multi-Head Attention consists of several\nattention layers running in parallel.\nquery with all keys, divide each by \u221a\ndk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\ninto a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute\nthe matrix of outputs as:\ndk\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multiplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\ndk\n. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\nmatrix multiplication code.\nWhile for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\nextremely small gradients 4\n. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by \u221a\ndk\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\nwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned\nlinear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of\nqueries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional\noutput values. These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the final values, as\ndepicted in Figure 2.\nMulti-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation\nsubspaces at different positions. With a single attention head, averaging inhibits this.\n4To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of q and k are independent random\nvariables with mean 0 and variance 1. Then their dot product, q \u00b7 k =\nPdk\ni=1 qiki, has mean 0 and variance dk.\ni\ni\ni\nWhere the projections are parameter matrices W\nIn this work we employ h = 8 parallel attention layers, or heads. For each of these we use\ndk = dv = dmodel/h = 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\n\u2022 In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\n\u2022 The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\n\u2022 Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to \u2212\u221e) all values in the input\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transformation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\nlinear transformation, similar to [24]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by \u221a\n3.5 Positional Encoding\nSince our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the\norder of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the\ntokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\nTable 1: Maximum path lengths, per-layer complexity and minimum number of sequential operations\nfor different layer types. n is the sequence length, d is the representation dimension, k is the kernel\nsize of convolutions and r the size of the neighborhood in restricted self-attention.\nLayer Type Complexity per Layer Sequential Maximum Path Length\nOperations\nRecurrent O(n \u00b7 d\nConvolutional O(k \u00b7 n \u00b7 d\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks.

There are many choices of positional encodings,\nlearned and fixed [8].\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\nwhere pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2\u03c0 to 10000 \u00b7 2\u03c0. We\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k, P Epos+k can be represented as a linear function of\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [8] instead, and found that the two\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\nduring training.\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolutional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\n(x1, ..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., zn), with xi\nd\n, such as a hidden\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\nconsider three desiderata.\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [11]. Hence we also compare\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\ndifferent layer types.\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\nlength n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with\nsentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece\n[31] and byte-pair [25] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in\nthe input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output\npositions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\nor O(logk(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [15], increasing the length of the longest paths\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [6], however, decrease the complexity\nconsiderably, to O(k \u00b7 n \u00b7 d + n \u00b7 d\n). Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\nthe approach we take in our model.\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions\nfrom our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention\nheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\nand semantic structure of the sentences.\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\n5.1 Training Data and Batching\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\nsentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [3], which has a shared sourcetarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\nvocabulary [31]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\ntarget tokens.\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\n5.3 Optimizer\n. We varied the learning\nrate over the course of training, according to the formula:\nlrate = d\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup_steps training steps,\nand decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used\n5.4 Regularization\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\nResidual Dropout We apply dropout [27] to the output of each sub-layer, before it is added to the\nsub-layer input and normalized. In addition, we apply dropout to the sums of the embeddings and the\npositional encodings in both the encoder and decoder stacks. For the base model, we use a rate of\nTable 2: The Transformer achieves better BLEU scores than previous state-of-the-art models on the\nEnglish-to-German and English-to-French newstest2014 tests at a fraction of the training cost.\nModel\nBLEU Training Cost (FLOPs)\nLabel Smoothing During training, we employed label smoothing of value \u000fls = 0.1 [30]. This\nhurts perplexity, as the model learns to be more unsure, but improves accuracy and BLEU score.\n6.1 Machine Translation\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, the big transformer model (Transformer (big)\nin Table 2) outperforms the best previously reported models (including ensembles) by more than 2.0\nBLEU, establishing a new state-of-the-art BLEU score of 28.4. The configuration of this model is\nlisted in the bottom line of Table 3. Training took 3.5 days on 8 P100 GPUs. Even our base model\nsurpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of\nthe competitive models.\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of 41.0,\noutperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than 1/4 the training cost of the\nprevious state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used\ndropout rate Pdrop = 0.1, instead of 0.3.\nFor the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which\nwere written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We\nused beam search with a beam size of 4 and length penalty \u03b1 = 0.6 [31]. These hyperparameters\nwere chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during\ninference to input length + 50, but terminate early when possible [31].\nTable 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model\narchitectures from the literature. We estimate the number of floating point operations used to train a\nmodel by multiplying the training time, the number of GPUs used, and an estimate of the sustained\n6.2 Model Variations\nTo evaluate the importance of different components of the Transformer, we varied our base model\nin different ways, measuring the change in performance on English-to-German translation on the\ndevelopment set, newstest2013. We used beam search as described in the previous section, but no\ncheckpoint averaging. We present these results in Table 3.\nIn Table 3 rows (A), we vary the number of attention heads and the attention key and value dimensions,\nkeeping the amount of computation constant, as described in Section 3.2.2. While single-head\nattention is 0.9 BLEU worse than the best setting, quality also drops off with too many heads.\n5We used values of 2.8, 3.7, 6.0 and 9.5 TFLOPS for K80, K40, M40 and P100, respectively.\nTable 3: Variations on the Transformer architecture. Unlisted values are identical to those of the base\nmodel. All metrics are on the English-to-German translation development set, newstest2013.

In row (E) we replace our\nsinusoidal positional encoding with learned positional embeddings [8], and observe nearly identical\nresults to the base model.\nIn this work, we presented the Transformer, the first sequence transduction model based entirely on\nattention, replacing the recurrent layers most commonly used in encoder-decoder architectures with\nFor translation tasks, the Transformer can be trained significantly faster than architectures based\non recurrent or convolutional layers.

In the former task our best\nmodel outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\nplan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\nto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs\nsuch as images, audio and video.

The index of the index file is\n    }``` right?  While you are doing your analysis make sure you explain to me what the code is doing, it's well commented but your comments might help.  And focus on getting this part right first: `    Functionality: The binary search operations in functions like hdb_binsrch_lookup_str can be parallelized by employing multiple threads to search different segments of the sorted index array concurrently.\n    Approach: Divide the sorted index array into segments and assign each segment to a different thread for searching. This approach is especially beneficial when multiple keys need to be searched in the index, as it can significantly reduce the overall search time.`",
        "Yes keep going to find the actual binary search and then summarize here, using snippets, to show how this binary search works.  Then lets work on implementing just dividing work among Cuda threads first, ie. parallelizing the work load.  ",
        "binsrch_index.cppFilethere you go, you don't have to guess.",
        "Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Is this a recursive binary search?  So first iteration, low to up is the entire array?  That could be huge for a hash database right?",
        "Well I guess it's better than no parallelization regardless of how big the array is right?  So lets start, why don't you start writing the kernel for the... wait what's the kernel going to do?  We divide up the array by number of threads,  and each thread will check if its own middle is equal to the hash then if it is return a signal that the search is over, if not then return some default signal which could say lower or higher?  Then these messages need to be synchronized back in the host or some central place, assert that the  messages make logical sense and so if there are k subarrays at runtime  of O(k) need to find the parts of this message array that is like [...higher, lower,...]  which means the new low and high would be the middles of these two subsequent arrays right?  Ie. the only place the hash string being searched could be is between those.  But also consider CUDA kernels that use grid stride loops and then calculate how to assign a certain chunk of the array to threads and let them grid stride through it?  With grid striding, no matter how big the hash database and how small my number of threads with a weaker GPU, I'm guaranteed to get some parallelism wouldn't I?  Give me your honest thoughts on my thoughts here and which way you wan to take this.",
        "Yes, I like it so far but probably want to use grid stride in the logic for reasons already stated.  Also what are atomic operations in `Synchronize and Decide: Use atomic operations or a synchronization mechanism to gather reports from all threads and decide the new range or conclude the search.` I am not famililar with sync_threads() too much but was just thinking of using CudaDeviceSynchronize()?  Is that too basic, did you have something better in mind?",
        "I think atomic operations might slow down the entire code.  But I like the kernel you wrote so go ahead and do the host side and whatever else you want to do.",
        "wait but you need all the code to make this actually work on hash databases right?  So you're going to have to replicate a lot of the code that is not directly binary search in binsrch_index.cpp but the other stuff that would get this new Cuda file working in the tsk package?  And then compilation has to be different I\"m sure of that right?  So where can we isolate the sleuth kit package to just be about hfind, ie. just need all the files that binsrch_index.cpp includes or uses and then we can copy them over to a new directory (is this the best way?), then add the new cuda file, write a new cmake and makefile or just a makefile, test it on the hash databases, time the executions and then also run the legacy hfind time it and then compare these in a Python Jupyter notebook.  Report findings to the sleuth kit repo owner to see if we can do a pull request.",

You can inspect the request there to see the plugin_id. We expect the state to be passed along when you redirect back to redirect_uri. If the state doesn't match the initial state, or has expired, the authentication flow will fail.\nAfter your plugin redirects back to the given redirect_uri, ChatGPT will complete the OAuth flow by making a POST request to the authorization_url with content type authorization_content_type and parameters { \u201cgrant_type\u201d: \u201cauthorization_code\u201d, \u201cclient_id\u201d: [client_id], \u201cclient_secret\u201d: [client_secret], \u201ccode\u201d: [the code that was returned with the redirect], \u201credirect_uri\u201d: [the same redirect uri as before] }.\nIf I am developing a sign in flow at what route does the user enter their credentials?",

        "What I Worked On\nBefore college the two main things I worked on, outside of school, were writing and programming. I didn't write essays. I wrote what beginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still are: short stories. My stories were awful. They had hardly any plot, just characters with strong feelings, which I imagined made them deep.\nThe first programs I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our school district used for what was then called \"data processing.\" This was in 9th grade, so I was 13 or 14. The school district's 1401 happened to be in the basement of our junior high school, and my friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it. It was like a mini Bond villain's lair down there, with all these alien-looking machines \u00e2\u20ac\u201d CPU, disk drives, printer, card reader \u00e2\u20ac\u201d sitting up on a raised floor under bright fluorescent lights.\nThe language we used was an early version of Fortran. You had to type programs on punch cards, then stack them in the card reader and press a button to load the program into memory and run it. The result would ordinarily be to print something on the spectacularly loud printer.\nI was puzzled by the 1401. I couldn't figure out what to do with it. And in retrospect there's not much I could have done with it. The only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards, and I didn't have any data stored on punched cards. The only other option was to do things that didn't rely on any input, like calculate approximations of pi, but I didn't know enough math to do anything interesting of that type. So I'm not surprised I can't remember any programs I wrote, because they can't have done much. My clearest memory is of the moment I learned it was possible for programs not to terminate, when one of mine didn't. On a machine without time-sharing, this was a social as well as a technical error, as the data center manager's expression made clear.\nWith microcomputers, everything changed. Now you could have a computer sitting right in front of you, on a desk, that could respond to your keystrokes as it was running instead of just churning through a stack of punch cards and then stopping. [1]\nThe first of my friends to get a microcomputer built it himself. It was sold as a kit by Heathkit. I remember vividly how impressed and envious I felt watching him sitting in front of it, typing programs right into the computer.\nComputers were expensive in those days and it took me years of nagging before I convinced my father to buy one, a TRS-80, in about 1980. The gold standard then was the Apple II, but a TRS-80 was good enough. This was when I really started programming. I wrote simple games, a program to predict how high my model rockets would fly, and a word processor that my father used to write at least one book. There was only room in memory for about 2 pages of text, so he'd write 2 pages at a time and then print them out, but it was a lot better than a typewriter.",
        " In college I was going to study philosophy, which sounded much more powerful. It seemed, to my naive high school self, to be the study of the ultimate truths, compared to which the things studied in other fields would be mere domain knowledge. What I discovered when I got to college was that the other fields took up so much of the space of ideas that there wasn't much left for these supposed ultimate truths. All that seemed left for philosophy were edge cases that people in other fields felt could safely be ignored.\nI couldn't have put this into words when I was 18. All I knew at the time was that I kept taking philosophy courses and they kept being boring. So I decided to switch to AI.\nAI was in the air in the mid 1980s, but there were two things especially that made me want to work on it: a novel by Heinlein called The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, which featured an intelligent computer called Mike, and a PBS documentary that showed Terry Winograd using SHRDLU. I haven't tried rereading The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, so I don't know how well it has aged, but when I read it I was drawn entirely into its world. It seemed only a matter of time before we'd have Mike, and when I saw Winograd using SHRDLU, it seemed like that time would be a few years at most. All you had to do was teach SHRDLU more words.\nThere weren't any classes in AI at Cornell then, not even graduate classes, so I started trying to teach myself. Which meant learning Lisp, since in those days Lisp was regarded as the language of AI. The commonly used programming languages then were pretty primitive, and programmers' ideas correspondingly so. The default language at Cornell was a Pascal-like language called PL/I, and the situation was similar elsewhere. Learning Lisp expanded my concept of a program so fast that it was years before I started to have a sense of where the new limits were. This was more like it; this was what I had expected college to do. It wasn't happening in a class, like it was supposed to, but that was ok. For the next couple years I was on a roll. I knew what I was going to do.\nFor my undergraduate thesis, I reverse-engineered SHRDLU. My God did I love working on that program. It was a pleasing bit of code, but what made it even more exciting was my belief \u00e2\u20ac\u201d hard to imagine now, but not unique in 1985 \u00e2\u20ac\u201d that it was already climbing the lower slopes of intelligence.\nI had gotten into a program at Cornell that didn't make you choose a major. You could take whatever classes you liked, and choose whatever you liked to put on your degree. I of course chose \"Artificial Intelligence.\" When I got the actual physical diploma, I was dismayed to find that the quotes had been included, which made them read as scare-quotes. At the time this bothered me, but now it seems amusingly accurate, for reasons I was about to discover.\nI applied to 3 grad schools: MIT and Yale, which were renowned for AI at the time, and Harvard, which I'd visited because Rich Draves went there, and was also home to Bill Woods, who'd invented the type of parser I used in my SHRDLU clone. Only Harvard accepted me, so that was where I went.\nI don't remember the moment it happened, or if there even was a specific moment, but during the first year of grad school I realized that AI, as practiced at the time, was a hoax. By which I mean the sort of AI in which a program that's told \"the dog is sitting on the chair\" translates this into some formal representation and adds it to the list of things it knows.\nWhat these programs really showed was that there's a subset of natural language that's a formal language. But a very proper subset. It was clear that there was an unbridgeable gap between what they could do and actually understanding natural language. It was not, in fact, simply a matter of teaching SHRDLU more words. That whole way of doing AI, with explicit data structures representing concepts, was not going to work. Its brokenness did, as so often happens, generate a lot of opportunities to write papers about various band-aids that could be applied to it, but it was never going to get us Mike.\nSo I looked around to see what I could salvage from the wreckage of my plans, and there was Lisp. I knew from experience that Lisp was interesting for its own sake and not just for its association with AI, even though that was the main reason people cared about it at the time. So I decided to focus on Lisp. In fact, I decided to write a book about Lisp hacking. It's scary to think how little I knew about Lisp hacking when I started writing that book. But there's nothing like writing a book about something to help you learn it. The book, On Lisp, wasn't published till 1993, but I wrote much of it in grad school.\nComputer Science is an uneasy alliance between two halves, theory and systems. The theory people prove things, and the systems people build things. I wanted to build things. I had plenty of respect for theory \u00e2\u20ac\u201d indeed, a sneaking suspicion that it was the more admirable of the two halves \u00e2\u20ac\u201d but building things seemed so much more exciting.\nThe problem with systems work, though, was that it didn't last. Any program you wrote today, no matter how good, would be obsolete in a couple decades at best. People might mention your software in footnotes, but no one would actually use it. And indeed, it would seem very feeble work. Only people with a sense of the history of the field would even realize that, in its time, it had been good.\nThere were some surplus Xerox Dandelions floating around the computer lab at one point. Anyone who wanted one to play around with could have one. I was briefly tempted, but they were so slow by present standards; what was the point? No one else wanted one either, so off they went. That was what happened to systems work.\nI wanted not just to build things, but to build things that would last."

        "The user is using a stylus to write text in the Excalidraw Obsidian plugin using the \"freedraw\" tool. This tool creates perfectfreehand json objects with the points for each of the strokes and a timestamp `updated` to mark when the freedraw element was last updated. Your task is to write an Excalidraw Automate script to group freedraw strokes that belong to a single word. We will do the grouping by sorting freedraw elements based on the `updated` timestamp and creating sequence of strokes that were completed close to each other in time. `updated` is measured in UNIX time milliseconds. \n Excalidraw Automate uses javascript. Here's a skeleton you can work from:\nconst MAXTIMEDELAY_MS = 30; //the maximum delay between two subsequent strokes to be considered as to-be grouped\nconst strokeGroups = []; //this will be an array of arrays storing the elements[i].id for each element that should be grouped with each other.",

        "Could you make me Dockerfile for project https://github.com/PromtEngineer/localGPT\nPlease ask me as many questions as will help you in preparation of Dockefile and other required files,\nHere is description of project from it's README.md file:\nThis project was inspired by the original [privateGPT](https://github.com/imartinez/privateGPT). Most of the description here is inspired by the original privateGPT.\nFor detailed overview of the project, Watch this [Youtube Video](https://youtu.be/MlyoObdIHyo).\nIn this model, I have replaced the GPT4ALL model with Vicuna-7B model and we are using the InstructorEmbeddings instead of LlamaEmbeddings as used in the original privateGPT. Both Embeddings as well as LLM will run on GPU instead of CPU. It also has CPU support if you do not have a GPU (see below for instruction).\nAsk questions to your documents without an internet connection, using the power of LLMs. 100% private, no data leaves your execution environment at any point. You can ingest documents and ask questions without an internet connection!\nIn order to set your environment up to run the code here, first install all requirements:\npip install -r requirements.txt\nThen install AutoGPTQ - if you want to run quantized models for GPU\ngit clone https://github.com/PanQiWei/AutoGPTQ.git\ngit checkout v0.2.2\nFor more support on [AutoGPTQ] (https://github.com/PanQiWei/AutoGPTQ).\nThis repo uses a [Constitution of USA ](https://constitutioncenter.org/media/files/constitution.pdf) as an example.\nPut any and all of your .txt, .pdf, or .csv files into the SOURCE_DOCUMENTS directory\nin the load_documents() function, replace the docs_path with the absolute path of your source_documents directory.\nThe current default file types are .txt, .pdf, .csv, and .xlsx, if you want to use any other file type, you will need to convert it to one of the default file types.\nRun the following command to ingest all the data.\npython ingest.py  # defaults to cuda\nUse the device type argument to specify a given device.\npython ingest.py --device_type cpu\nUse help for a full list of supported devices.\nIt will create an index containing the local vectorstore. Will take time, depending on the size of your documents.\nYou can ingest as many documents as you want, and all will be accumulated in the local embeddings database.\nIf you want to start from an empty database, delete the `index`.\nNote: When you run this for the first time, it will download take time as it has to download the embedding model. In the subseqeunt runs, no data will leave your local enviroment and can be run without internet connection.\nIn order to ask a question, run a command like:\npython run_localGPT.py\nAnd wait for the script to require your input.\n> Enter a query:\nHit enter. Wait while the LLM model consumes the prompt and prepares the answer. Once done, it will print the answer and the 4 sources it used as context from your documents; you can then ask another question without re-running the script, just wait for the prompt again.\nNote: When you run this for the first time, it will need internet connection to download the vicuna-7B model. After that you can turn off your internet connection, and the script inference would still work. No data gets out of your local environment.\nType `exit` to finish the script.\nBy default, localGPT will use your GPU to run both the `ingest.py` and `run_localGPT.py` scripts. But if you do not have a GPU and want to run this on CPU, now you can do that (Warning: Its going to be slow!). You will need to use `--device_type cpu`flag with both scripts.\nFor Ingestion run the following:\npython ingest.py --device_type cpu\nIn order to ask a question, run a command like:\npython run_localGPT.py --device_type cpu\n1. Start by opening up `run_localGPT_API.py` in a code editor of your choice. If you are using gpu skip to step 3.\n2. If you are running on cpu change `DEVICE_TYPE = 'cuda'` to `DEVICE_TYPE = 'cpu'`.\n   - If you are running gpu there should be nothing to change. Save and close `run_localGPT_API.py`.\n3. Open up a terminal and activate your python environment that contains the dependencies installed from requirements.txt.\n4. Navigate to the `/LOCALGPT` directory.\n5. Run the following command `python run_localGPT_API.py`. The API should being to run.\n6. Wait until everything has loaded in. You should see something like `INFO:werkzeug:Press CTRL+C to quit`.\n7. Open up a second terminal and activate the same python environment.\n8. Navigate to the `/LOCALGPT/localGPTUI` directory.\n10. Open up a web browser and go the address `http://localhost:5111/`.\nSelecting the right local models and the power of `LangChain` you can run the entire pipeline locally, without any data leaving your environment, and with reasonable performance.\n- `ingest.py` uses `LangChain` tools to parse the document and create embeddings locally using `InstructorEmbeddings`. It then stores the result in a local vector database using `Chroma` vector store.\n- `run_localGPT.py` uses a local LLM (Vicuna-7B in this case) to understand questions and create answers. The context for the answers is extracted from the local vector store using a similarity search to locate the right piece of context from the docs.\n- You can replace this local LLM with any other LLM from the HuggingFace. Make sure whatever LLM you select is in the HF format.\nThe following will provide instructions on how you can select a different LLM model to create your response:\n1. Open up `run_localGPT.py`\n3. Go to the comment where it says `# load the LLM for generating Natural Language responses`\n4. Below it, it details a bunch of examples on models from HuggingFace that have already been tested to be run with the original trained model (ending with HF or have a .bin in its \"Files and versions\"), and quantized models (ending with GPTQ or have a .no-act-order or .safetensors in its \"Files and versions\").\n5. For models that end with HF or have a .bin inside its \"Files and versions\" on its HuggingFace page.\n   - Make sure you have a model_id selected. For example -> `model_id = \"TheBloke/guanaco-7B-HF\"`\n   - If you go to its HuggingFace [Site] (https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/guanaco-7B-HF) and go to \"Files and versions\" you will notice model files that end with a .bin extension.\n   - Any model files that contain .bin extensions will be run with the following code where the `# load the LLM for generating Natural Language responses` comment is found.\n6. For models that contain GPTQ in its name and or have a .no-act-order or .safetensors extension inside its \"Files and versions on its HuggingFace page.\n   - Make sure you have a model_id selected. For example -> model_id = `\"TheBloke/wizardLM-7B-GPTQ\"`\n   - You will also need its model basename file selected. For example -> `model_basename = \"wizardLM-7B-GPTQ-4bit.compat.no-act-order.safetensors\"`\n   - If you go to its HuggingFace [Site] (https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/wizardLM-7B-GPTQ) and go to \"Files and versions\" you will notice a model file that ends with a .safetensors extension.\n   - Any model files that contain no-act-order or .safetensors extensions will be run with the following code where the `# load the LLM for generating Natural Language responses` comment is found.\n7. Comment out all other instances of `model_id=\"other model names\"`, `model_basename=other base model names`, and `llm = load_model(args*)`\nTo use this software, you must have Python 3.10 or later installed. Earlier versions of Python will not compile.\nIf you encounter an error while building a wheel during the `pip install` process, you may need to install a C++ compiler on your computer.\nTo install a C++ compiler on Windows 10/11, follow these steps:\n1. Install Visual Studio 2022.\n2. Make sure the following components are selected:\n3. Download the MinGW installer from the [MinGW website](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/).\n4. Run the installer and select the \"gcc\" component.\nFollow this [page](https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-install-the-nvidia-drivers-on-ubuntu-22-04) to install NVIDIA Drivers.\n1- Follow this [page](https://developer.apple.com/metal/pytorch/) to build up PyTorch with Metal Performance Shaders (MPS) support. PyTorch uses the new MPS backend for GPU training acceleration. It is good practice to verify mps support using a simple Python script as mentioned in the provided link.\n2- By following the page, here is an example of what you may initiate in your terminal\nconda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio -c pytorch-nightly\npip install chardet\npip install cchardet\npip uninstall charset_normalizer\npip install pdfminer.six\npip install xformers\n3- Please keep in mind that the quantized models are not yet supported by Apple Silicon (M1/M2) by auto-gptq library that is being used for loading quantized models, [see here](https://github.com/PanQiWei/AutoGPTQ/issues/133#issuecomment-1575002893). Therefore, you will not be able to run quantized models on M1/M2.\nThis is a test project to validate the feasibility of a fully local solution for question answering using LLMs and Vector embeddings. It is not production ready, and it is not meant to be used in production. Vicuna-7B is based on the Llama model so that has the original Llama license.",

This is the repository for the 7B fine-tuned model, optimized for dialogue use cases and converted for the Hugging Face Transformers format. Links to other models can be found in the index at the bottom.\nModel Details\nNote: Use of this model is governed by the Meta license. In order to download the model weights and tokenizer, please visit the website and accept our License before requesting access here.\nMeta developed and publicly released the Llama 2 family of large language models (LLMs), a collection of pretrained and fine-tuned generative text models ranging in scale from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters. Our fine-tuned LLMs, called Llama-2-Chat, are optimized for dialogue use cases. Llama-2-Chat models outperform open-source chat models on most benchmarks we tested, and in our human evaluations for helpfulness and safety, are on par with some popular closed-source models like ChatGPT and PaLM.\nModel Developers Meta\nVariations Llama 2 comes in a range of parameter sizes \u2014 7B, 13B, and 70B \u2014 as well as pretrained and fine-tuned variations.\nInput Models input text only.\nOutput Models generate text only.\nModel Architecture Llama 2 is an auto-regressive language model that uses an optimized transformer architecture. The tuned versions use supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) to align to human preferences for helpfulness and safety.\nLlama 2\tA new mix of publicly available online data\t7B\t4k\t\u2717\t2.0T\t3.0 x 10-4\nLlama 2\tA new mix of publicly available online data\t13B\t4k\t\u2717\t2.0T\t3.0 x 10-4\nLlama 2\tA new mix of publicly available online data\t70B\t4k\t\u2714\t2.0T\t1.5 x 10-4\nLlama 2 family of models. Token counts refer to pretraining data only. All models are trained with a global batch-size of 4M tokens. Bigger models - 70B -- use Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) for improved inference scalability.\nModel Dates Llama 2 was trained between January 2023 and July 2023.\nStatus This is a static model trained on an offline dataset. Future versions of the tuned models will be released as we improve model safety with community feedback.\nLicense A custom commercial license is available at: https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama-downloads/\nResearch Paper \"Llama-2: Open Foundation and Fine-tuned Chat Models\"\nIntended Use\nIntended Use Cases Llama 2 is intended for commercial and research use in English. Tuned models are intended for assistant-like chat, whereas pretrained models can be adapted for a variety of natural language generation tasks.\nTo get the expected features and performance for the chat versions, a specific formatting needs to be followed, including the INST and <<SYS>> tags, BOS and EOS tokens, and the whitespaces and breaklines in between (we recommend calling strip() on inputs to avoid double-spaces). See our reference code in github for details: chat_completion.\nOut-of-scope Uses Use in any manner that violates applicable laws or regulations (including trade compliance laws).Use in languages other than English. Use in any other way that is prohibited by the Acceptable Use Policy and Licensing Agreement for Llama 2.\nHardware and Software\nTraining Factors We used custom training libraries, Meta's Research Super Cluster, and production clusters for pretraining. Fine-tuning, annotation, and evaluation were also performed on third-party cloud compute.\nCarbon Footprint Pretraining utilized a cumulative 3.3M GPU hours of computation on hardware of type A100-80GB (TDP of 350-400W). Estimated total emissions were 539 tCO2eq, 100% of which were offset by Meta\u2019s sustainability program.\nCO2 emissions during pretraining. Time: total GPU time required for training each model. Power Consumption: peak power capacity per GPU device for the GPUs used adjusted for power usage efficiency. 100% of the emissions are directly offset by Meta's sustainability program, and because we are openly releasing these models, the pretraining costs do not need to be incurred by others.\nTraining Data\nOverview Llama 2 was pretrained on 2 trillion tokens of data from publicly available sources. The fine-tuning data includes publicly available instruction datasets, as well as over one million new human-annotated examples. Neither the pretraining nor the fine-tuning datasets include Meta user data.\nData Freshness The pretraining data has a cutoff of September 2022, but some tuning data is more recent, up to July 2023.\nJust relpy normally. not sure how to navigate this",

        "I'm building an authentication workflow that involves sending an email with a magic link to verify the user's email. I want to avoid doing anything in the database regarding the magic link. So I encrypt a payload (includes the email it's intended for and it doesn't include an expiration currently, but it certainly could) and include that encrypted token in the email as a query parameter on the magic link. However, I just realized that I was hard-coding the salt which reduces the level of security and opens me up to brute force attacks.\nI'd still like to avoid touching the database for this, so I don't want to have to generate the salt and put it in the database. I considered putting the generated salt in the magic link query string as well. I realize this reduces the security a bit, but I'm wondering whether in a practical scenario if it's really that big of an issue and if I can address any holes that opens me up to.\nI'd love to hear your thoughts on this. Feel free to make a completely different suggestion I may not have considered or tell me that I really should just write something to the database for this process.\nI have also considered putting the salt in the user's session.\nI'm also adding a feature that allows the user to enter 5 random numbers into the app instead of clicking a link. Those numbers will be encrypted using the same method and that encrypted value will be stored in a cookie.\nHopefully that's enough context for you to make a recommendation on what I should do about the salt.",
        "Thanks. A few follow-ups:\n- For option 1, I hadn't considered this. Thwarting precomputed dictionary attacks is my primary objective, because it's the main vulnerability I'm trying to fix. Are there other vulnerabilities I should be concerned about? This option doesn't seem any more complicated to implement or maintain than option 2 and that feels safer. Is it?\n- For option 2, I think I prefer this option. Are there other considerations I should keep in mind?\n- For option 3, I could avoid writing to the database if I put the value of the salt in a cookie. The attacker would still have access to it if they submitted it themselves, but they wouldn't have access to the salt if they hacked into people's emails. However, this has the drawback of the user being unable to sign in from a different browser from the one that requested the token which I've already experienced in another app as something people complain about. So is the concern about someone hacking into people's emails all that valid in a practical scenario?\n- For option 4, Wouldn't another downside of the JWT token approach be that it is vulnerable to rainbow tables as well?\n- This sounds like a pretty good solution. Would it be reasonable to use a TOTP both as something I display for people to type as well as a query param in the magic link? Are TOTPs too long to expect a user to type? Keep in mind they may not be able to copy/paste because they may be using a different device to look at the email from the one they're typing into.",

So I was thinking of generating a random key and setting that as an environment variable which every one of these uses. Why would that be a problem with this?",
        "Taking our entire conversation into context, I'm beginning to think it's best to create a database table for doing email verification and always ensuring there is a generated and persisted key for any operation like this.\nIf I were to change my preference of avoiding using the database to store the key, what would you recommend I do for email verification during onboarding assuming I want to keep the user experience of a magic link option as well as a short 5-6 digit number verification option.",
        "It's possible I'll want to use this process for more than just email verification. What issues do you foresee with me making this database table more generic? So instead of \"email\" we'd use more generic terms?",
        "Is the type field necessary? I think it would be safe to remove this. I think I would like to do that so I don't have to have an additional relational table. Can we remove that?\nI'm thinking instead of \"generation_time\" I'll use \"expirationTime\" which will make it easier for a background job to know whether it's safe to delete. Any issues with that?\nCould you write out the part of a prisma schema relevant to the model(s) necessary for this?",
        "Would it be reasonable for me to disassociate the verification model from the user? In the case of registration, I don't have a user yet. I'm thinking for registration I could just lookup the verification by the otp which would then allow me to create a new user by the identifier (which would be the email). Would doing this limit the usefulness of this model?",
        "For point 3, I could make the identifier be equal to the User ID. But that may be a bit ambiguous which makes me think bringing back the relational model for the `type` field would be useful. Which approach do you think strikes the best balance between complexity and flexibility?",
        "I'm using SQLite which doesn't support enum. Could you update the VerificationType to address this. Also, I don't think we need to include the User model anymore.\nAlso, is the term \"identifier\" the best option for what that really represents?",
        "Would that `@@unique` directive work if I used `upsert` when creating verification codes for which one of that type already exists?\nAlso, if I wanted to use a table for the `type` instead of a string, how would I do that?",
        "Nevermind. Let's leave the verification type as a string. I don't think it's enough of a benefit to have a separate model.",
        "What are the drawbacks of having more than one combination of verificationTarget and type?",
        "Ok, sounds good. I'm satisfied with the model and the architecture we've discussed. I'm considering whether I should include this model in my application database or if I should create a separate database for this. I'm using SQLite for all my databases and I already have a separate one for caching, so adding another one for verification doesn't feel like a big issue, particularly since the model is so simple so I wouldn't actually need prisma to manage it. Please argue both sides of this decision and make a recommendation.",
        "Good arguments. I think I'll keep it in the main database.\nCould you please write the module that uses prisma and manages creating and verifying TOTPs and handle edge cases where a second verification is created for the same type and target.",

Let's make function arguments objects that are destructured in the argument list position.\n4. Let's make the expiration time an argument\n5. Could you fill in the `generateSecretKey` function with an implementation?",
        "I'm thinking more about this. Going back to the original issue of hard coding the salt, can you describe what an adversary would have to do to exploit the vulnerability here? Perhaps I can do away with the salt entirely and simply encrypt it with a secret key. Also consider I could make it so the encrypted token is only valid for a short period. If I don't store the encrypted values in a database anywhere, how would my email verification method be practically susceptible to a rainbow table attack? Or would it be vulnerable to another kind of attack I'm not considering?\nWhat steps would an attacker have to follow to crack my encryption even with a shared salt? If it's impractical, is there another method of encryption I could use that would still allow me to use a shared secret key and not bother with a salt since I won't need to store the values in a database anyway?",
        "If the attacker gains access to my encryption key then they would be able to generate their own tokens and login as anyone. It's pretty well accepted that's bad news.\nFrom what I can tell, following the TOTP approach we've arrived at above would be the safest approach because even if the verifications table was breached, the attackers would have limited use for that as they would only be able to impersonate users whose verification had not yet expired (and with reasonably short expirations that would limit the number of vulnerable users drastically). Additionally, there's no secret key that could be lost, so they also wouldn't be able to generate their own valid tokens. An attacker would need to get write access to the database in which case we'd probably have even bigger problems anyway (so we'll apply good security practices around database access already). Am I missing something about the vulnerabilities around the TOTP? Is it a correct characterization to say that TOTP is similar in spirit to what I'm doing already except there's no salt and instead the encryption secret is randomly generated for every instance of verification and saved to the database and only valid before the expiration time?",
        "I want to clarify something around the idea of the \"shared secret\" and the \"server\" and \"client.\" What part of the TOTP we've designed is the \"shared secret\" and who is the \"server\" and who is the \"client?\"\nFrom what I can tell, the shared secret is the `secretKey` which is stored in the database. I don't believe that is shared with the client which is why I'm confused by the \"shared\" adjective here.\nAnd the \"server\" and \"client\" in my instance is just the node.js server. I don't think we want to send anything other than the `otp` in the email.",
        "Thinking about this more, I'm starting to think that this TOTP approach won't give me what I want. I was hoping to be able to let users verify their email address by typing a 5-6 digit number or clicking a link which includes that number in the query string. But it's possible (unlikely, but still possible) that two users could get the same number at the same time. I don't know how I'd prevent that or differentiate between those users.",
        "Ok, that's fine. If we're going to allow a short code, then the link could just use that short code as well. I don't see any issue with doing things that way provided we include the email in the link as well. So maybe the link could be something like: `https://example.com/verify?code=12345&email=me%40example.com`.",
        "I'm still feeling uncertain. It seems like I'm giving up the simplicity of having an environment variable which I need to keep secret and a couple very simple TS methods in favor of a database table and a more complex verification process. All because I'm vulnerable to the environment variable leaking. The only situation where the environment variable could leak is if someone gains access to my VM which would actually open me up to a lot worse problems either way anyway. I'm just starting to think this is unnecessary work to change. Please weigh the options.",
        "Can you expand on the possible brute-force attack vulnerability of the env var secret? Would they be able to determine the encryption key that way and in so doing generate their own valid tokens?\nAlso, if an attacker were able to gain access to my server environment, they would be able to access the SQLite database as well which means they could do much worse things than impersonate a user, so unless I'm missing something, that point is not a good argument against keeping things as they are.",
        "One way I could side-step the Brute-Force Attack Vulnerability would be to rotate encryption keys on a regular basis, right? If so, what's a reasonable frequency for that? I'm thinking that I could have a short grace period for old secrets as well to avoid issues with tokens generated moments before the switch. Would this resolve the brute-force attack vulnerability?\nIf so, are there any other vulnerabilities I'm not considering?",
        "Sounds like proper key rotation would involve even more complexity than TOTP we've discussed because it will require a database table for the secret and a background job for rotating keys. Instead of dealing with all that, just having a database table to store the short lived unique keys for individual users seems much more simple and even more secure. So the only scenario where a shared encryption key makes sense in this situation is where you decide you don't have a fear of people taking the time and resources to guess your encryption secret key. I don't want to take that gamble for what I'm building, so I think it's best to make the Verification table as we discussed.\nHowever, it looks like notp does not allow you to customize the algorithm used and it uses SHA1 which is no longer recommended due to security vulnerabilities. I'm considering just copy/paste/modifying that code into my codebase. Or is there another library I should use? I don't want to use `speakeasy` because it is quite old and has outstanding issues.",

However, it is challenging to develop efficient tensor programs for deep learning operators due to the high complexity of\nmodern accelerators (e.g., NVIDIA GPUs and Google TPUs) and\nthe rapidly growing number of operators.\nDeep learning compilers, such as Apache TVM, adopt declarative scheduling primitives to lower the bar of developing tensor\nprograms. However, we show that this approach is insufficient to\ncover state-of-the-art tensor program optimizations (e.g., double\nbuffering). In this paper, we propose to embed the scheduling process into tensor programs and use dedicated mappings, called task\nmappings, to define the computation assignment and ordering directly in the tensor programs. This new approach greatly enriches\nthe expressible optimizations by allowing developers to manipulate\ntensor programs at a much finer granularity (e.g., allowing programstatement-level optimizations).

However, manually tweaking a kernel to optimize for performance is laborious,\nerror-prone, and requires expertise in writing low-level language\ncodes. Thus, it is difficult to generalize to other input shapes, new\noperators, and kernel fusion patterns. In addition, template-based\nlibraries such as CUTLASS [32] employ C++ templates to generate\ntensor programs for different input shapes on the fly. Although\ntemplate-based libraries can achieve competitive performance on\nmany input shapes by dynamically tuning the optimization hyperparameters, they do not reduce the complexity of writing tensor\nprograms for new operators and only provide limited fusion capability (e.g., only a small number of predefined operators can be\nfused with matrix multiplication).\nAlternatively, DL compilers [4, 9, 43, 44, 67] are proposed to compile deep learning networks into tensor programs automatically.\nExisting state-of-the-art DL compilers adopt the idea of decoupling computation definition and scheduling, originally proposed\nby Halide [43] and TVM [9]. The computation definition of an\noperator only defines how each element of the output tensor is\ncomputed mathematically, and the schedule defines the way the\nexecution is performed, such as the loop order and thread binding [9, 43]. Compilers leverage schedulers like AutoTVM [11] and\nAsnor [65] to tune the hyper-parameters of the schedule to optimize\noperator performance for each input shape. Unlike kernel libraries\nand templates that target a fixed set of operators and limited fusion\npatterns, compilers are capable of supporting more operators and\nmore flexible fusion patterns automatically.\nHowever, existing state-of-the-art compilers are mostly based on\nthe loop-oriented scheduling primitives, which manipulate the loop\nstructure of a tensor program in a declarative manner (e.g., loop split\nand reorder). Although loop-oriented scheduling primitives have\nachieved great success in simplifying tensor program writing [9,\n11, 65], certain key optimizations (e.g., double buffering [32]) are\nhard to implement. Specifically, loop-oriented scheduling primitives\ncannot express the fine-grained tensor program transformations\nrequired by the key optimizations discussed in Section 3.1. Besides,\nloop-oriented scheduling also suffers from the long kernel tuning\ntime due to the rarity of efficient schedules in the tremendous\ntuning spaces. For instance, AutoTVM [11] takes 15 hours to tune\na single CNN model Inception V3 [50] on a modern GPU.\nIn this work, we propose a new paradigm for writing efficient\ntensor programs: task-mapping-oriented programming paradigm.\nIn this paradigm, we define the parallelizable computations in an\noperator as tasks, and the process of assigning and ordering the\ntasks to parallel processing units (e.g., threads) as scheduling. The\ndevelopers can directly define the scheduling in the tensor program\nthrough task mappings 1\n. This paradigm simplifies the development\nof tensor programs without sacrificing the ability to express optimizations requiring fine-grained program manipulation. With the\nin-program style of scheduling, this paradigm also allows us to\nsearch the tensor program in an efficient hardware-centric schedule\nspace that is agnostic to input size to dramatically reduce the tuning\n1The name task mapping comes from the abstraction where a scheduling process\ncan be considered as the one that maps tasks to processing units in both spatial and\ntemporal dimensions.\ntime. We also propose post-scheduling fusion to fuse the scheduled\noperator with surrounding operators automatically, so developers\ndon\u2019t need to worry about fusion when writing schedule templates.\nWe implement a new DL compiler called Hidet based on the proposed ideas. In this work, we mainly focus on optimizing DNN inference on GPUs, as it is the most commonly used DNN accelerator.\nThe proposed ideas also apply to other accelerators such as CPUs\nand TPUs [31]. Extensive experiments on modern convolutional\nand transformer models show that Hidet outperforms state-of-theart DL inference frameworks and schedulers, AutoTVM [11] and\nAnsor [65], by up to 1.48\u00d7 (1.22\u00d7 on average) while reducing the\ntuning time of the two schedulers by 20\u00d7 and 11\u00d7, respectively.\nWe summarize our contributions as follows:\n\u2022 We identify and present the limited expressiveness of looporiented scheduling adopted by state-of-the-art DL compilers\nto be their fundamental limitation in efficiently compiling\ncomplex tensor programs (e.g., matrix multiplication).\n\u2022 We introduce the task-mapping-oriented programming paradigm to simplify tensor program development without sacrificing the expressiveness of optimizations compared with\nhand-crafted implementations.

In this way, a manual schedule becomes a schedule template and can be\noptimized by auto-tuning frameworks [11] for various input shapes\nand hardware. To further save the time of writing a schedule template, auto-scheduling approaches that automatically generate a\nschedule by applying predefined rules to the computation definition\nhave been proposed [2, 65].\nHowever, as we illustrate in the next section, the schedule space\nfrom the loop-oriented scheduling paradigm is still inefficient. As\na result, 1) it is challenging to achieve competitive performance\non operators that are highly optimized by kernel libraries since\nloop-oriented scheduling can not express some key optimizations,\n2) schedulers need hours to days to find the best schedule configuration in the schedule space.",
        "3.1 Limited Optimization Support\nThe declarative loop-oriented scheduling primitives suffer from\nlimited support for key optimizations. We use an important optimization, double buffering [6, 32], that has been adopted in several\nsupported by TVM [9], to illustrate this fundamental limitation.\nThe implementation of matrix multiplication in Figure 3 is suboptimal since all threads in the same thread blocks are likely to be\nblocked by one type of hardware resource (i.e., memory bandwidth\nin Step 2 or computation units in Step 3) while leaving the other idle.\nThis is because, in Figure 3, the data loading (L7) and computation\n(L10) use the same buffer, and synchronization (L8) needs to be\nused to satisfy data dependency.",
        "The double buffering optimization shown in Figure 5 alleviates\nthe aforementioned problem by using two buffers: one is used for\npre-loading the fragments for the next iteration (L8 and L10), while\nthe other is used for computation in the current iteration (L9). We\nfirst preload the next tile of matrix A and B into registers (L8),\nand store them to shared memory after the computation of the\ncurrent tile (L10). This is more efficient because computation in\nL9 can be executed while the global memory loading in L8 is on\nthe fly with thread-level parallelism. With double buffering, the threads in a thread block can utilize both memory accessing units\nand computation units at the same time.\nHowever, this optimization cannot be implemented using existing declarative loop-oriented scheduling primitives in Table 1.\nThis is because none of the schedule primitives can manipulate the\nloop body at a fine granularity3\n. As a result, although loop-oriented\nscheduling simplifies tensor program writing, its declarative style of\nscheduling prevents developers from implementing optimizations\nrequiring fine-grained manipulation of tensor programs. We want\nto highlight that double buffering optimization is only an example\nof the limited expressiveness of existing loop-oriented scheduling.\nBesides double buffering, thread block swizzle [7, 53] and efficient\nusage4 of Tensor Core MMA PTX instruction [28], and multi-stage\nasynchronous prefetching [32] are widely used optimizations in\nkernel libraries [26, 32], but are difficult to implement with declarative loop-oriented scheduling. To implement these optimizations,\nwe need a more expressive method to write tensor programs and\nschedule their computations.",
        "3.2 Dedicated Schedule Template for Fusion\nAnchor Op Element-wise Op\nFused Operator\nAnchor Op's Schedule Template\nFigure 6: Workflow of TVM sub-graph fusion.\nOne important advantage of compilers over kernel libraries is\nthe ability to optimize arbitrary workloads, especially workloads\nwith multiple fused operators (e.g., Conv2d-BN-ReLU in convolutional neural networks [25], and Reshape-Matmul-Transpose in\ntransformer models [16]). For example, Figure 6 illustrates how\nTVM [9] fuses Conv2d-BN-ReLU into a single kernel. Specifically,\nTVM groups operators to form sub-graphs. Each sub-graph can contain only one anchor operator, which is usually the most computeintensive one (e.g., convolution or matrix multiplication) with a\ncarefully designed schedule template. Then, the schedule template\nof the anchor operator will be used to schedule the entire sub-graph,\nmeaning that the schedule template has to support all possible fusion scenarios, which greatly increases the complexity of writing\nschedule templates. Although auto-schedulers (e.g., Ansor [65]) are\nproposed to generate schedule templates automatically from the\ncomputation definition with pre-defined auto-scheduling rules, it\nis challenging to extend the auto-schedulers with new rules. This\nis because the new rule has to be compatible with all existing rules\nand needs to be general enough to support all operators. Thus,\nit is still challenging to support fusion, while not increasing the\ncomplexity of writing specialized schedule templates.",
        "3.3 Long Tuning Time\nIn addition to expressiveness and extensibility, the tuning time\nof existing state-or-the-art schedulers [2, 11, 65] typically ranges\nfrom hours to days due to inefficient schedule spaces. The majority of their schedule spaces are composed of loop tiling factors.\nTo constrain the schedule space size and avoid conditional if-else\nbranches, existing schedulers only cover perfect tile sizes (i.e., only\ntile \ud835\udc5b-length loop with proper factors of \ud835\udc5b). For example, potential\ntile factors of a loop with length 10 only include 1, 2, 5, and 10. As a\nresult, the space constructed by these schedulers with loop-oriented\nscheduling depends on the input shapes of the target workload. We\nname this category of schedule space as input-centric schedule space.\nWe observe two challenges with input-centric schedule space. (1)\nThe schedule space size grows exponentially along with the number\nof input size factors. Figure 7 shows the number of schedules for\neach convolution in ResNet-50 [25]. There are up to 108\nschedules\nto search for a single convolutional layer. (2) The schedule space\nmight not include the schedule with optimal performance as nonperfect tile sizes are not considered. An extreme example is that\nboth Ansor and AutoTVM fail to find a valid schedule for matrix\nmultiplication with M=N=K=2039 because 2039 is a prime number.\nTo address the first challenge, the state-of-the-art schedulers [11,\n65] employ a cost model to predict the performance of schedules\nand use genetic evolution search to increase the search efficiency.\nHowever, the search process still requires about half an hour to tune\na single operator, resulting in 8 to 15 hours to tune an Inception\nV3 model [50]. Long tuning time prevents existing schedulers from\nupper-level applications such as neural architecture search [71].\nBoth of them need the latency of a kernel to guide their optimization\nand network searching within a short amount of tuning time.",
        "To address the challenges mentioned above, we propose a new\nprogramming paradigm for tensor programs \u2013 task-mapping programming paradigm (Section 4.1). This paradigm defines descriptive\nobjects, called task mapping, to specify the task assignment and\nordering. Task mappings replace the original loop-oriented scheduling primitives and are directly defined and used in the tensor program, which allows more optimizations compared with the existing\ndeclarative style of scheduling. We also propose post-scheduling fusion (Section 4.2) to simplify sub-graph scheduling by automatically\nfusing surrounding operators to the operator with scheduled tensor\nprogram. The proposed paradigm also enables efficient partial tiling",
        "4.1 Task-Mapping Programming Paradigm\nLoop-oriented scheduling manipulates a tensor program through\ndeclarative loop-oriented scheduling primitives to simplify the tensor programming, but at the same time prevents fine-grained manipulations and optimizations.\nWe observe that the goal of loop-oriented scheduling primitives\nis either to (1) assign the computations to parallel processing units\n(e.g., threads or warps), or (2) specify the execution order of the\ncomputations assigned to each processing unit. Figure 8 shows the\ncooperative loading of the matrix A in the matrix multiplication as\nan example (we omitted the block offset and only show the loading of the matrix A for simplicity). In this example, loop-oriented\nscheduling applies three primitives (i.e., loop split, fuse, and bind)\nto assign the loading of 512 (64x8) elements to 128 threads, and\neach thread loads 4 elements in order.\nInstead of scheduling through applying declarative primitives,\nwe propose to embed the scheduling into tensor programs and use\ndedicated mappings, called task mappings, to define the computations assignment and ordering directly in the program. We use the\nexample in Figure 8 to demonstrate how to use task mapping to\nfulfill the desired scheduling. In step (1), a task mapping is first\ndefined, which assigns 64x8 tasks to 128 threads. Then, in step (2),\neach task (i, k) assigned to a thread is iterated by calling the task\nmapping with thread index threadIdx.x. Finally, in step (3), the\ntask is implemented using its index (i, k). The three steps decouple the task assignment and the implementation of every single\ntask, greatly simplifying tensor program developments. Compared\nwith declarative loop-oriented scheduling, it schedules directly in\nthe tensor program and allows more fine-grained optimizations.\nBesides this, it also allows developers to fall back on some dimensions to traditional loops to implement optimizations such as double\nbuffering [32]. Since task mapping is the key component used in\nthe three steps, we name our new approach to construct tensor\nprograms \u2013 a task-mapping programming paradigm.\nThe task mapping defined in step (1) is derived from task mapping\ncomposition of two basic task mappings (i.e., repeat(4, 1) and\nspatial(16, 8)). The table in Figure 8 gives the details of all\nappeared task mappings. The formal definition of task mapping\nand its composition are given in Section 5.1.\nThe proposed paradigm simplifies tensor program development\nwithout sacrificing optimization expressiveness. Beyond the scheduling of a single operator, it is also important to schedule a fused\nsub-graph as operator fusion could greatly reduce the memo",
        "We propose to decompose the scheduling of a fused sub-graph into\ntwo steps, as shown in Figure 9. In step 1 , we select the anchor\noperator as TVM [9] does, but only schedule the anchor operator\nalone. In step 2 , we fuse the surrounding operators to the scheduled\ntensor program of the anchor operator automatically. With this\ndecoupling, the scheduling of the anchor operator does not need to\nconsider the whole sub-graph but only the implementation of itself,\nwhich greatly reduces the engineering efforts required to a design\nBecause the fusion is done after we schedule the operator, we call\nIn post-scheduling fusion, the anchor operator can be fused with\noperators before (as prologues) and after (as epilogues) it. We decide\nif an operator is fusible based on its characteristics. If an operator\nhas no reduction computation, it is defined as injective and qualified\nas a prologue operator. If an operator is injective and each element\nin the input tensor contributes to a single element in the output\ntensor, it is defined as bijective and qualified as an epilogue operator.\nFor example, all elementwise operators (e.g., addition, ReLU [3]) and\ntransform operators (e.g., reshape, transpose) are bijective operators\nand are qualified as both prologue and epilogue operators. With\npost-scheduling fusion, we can concentrate on the scheduling of a\nsingle operator while supporting flexible and effective fusion.",
        "4.3 Hardware-Centric Scheduling Space\nExisting state-of-the-art schedulers [11, 65] adopt the input-centric\nschedule space discussed in Section 3.3, in which the schedule\nchooses the proper factors of loop extent as the split or tile factors,\nwhich makes the schedule space unscalable and fails to cover the\noptimal performance derived from tile sizes that are not proper\nfactors of loop extents. In addition to constructing a schedule space\nbased on input sizes, another approach is to design the schedule\nspace based on hardware, named hardware-centric schedule space.\nHardware-centric schedule space decouples the schedule space from\nthe input size by employing predicated loading (i.e., protecting the\ndata loading by checking if the accessing indices are in bounds),\nand is widely used by kernel libraries [12, 26, 32].\nWith the proposed paradigm, we can provide a small but efficient\nhardware-centric schedule space. Since the tile factors are based\non hardware resources (e.g., 64x64, 128x64, 16x32, etc), hardwarecentric schedule spaces are orders of magnitude smaller than inputcentric schedule spaces. For example, the schedule space we adopted\nfor matrix multiplication contains less than 200 schedules, which\nis on average 105\u00d7 smaller than a typical schedule space in AutoTVM [11]. Simply enumerating all schedules would be enough\nand can be done within one minute of time.",
        "5.1 Task-Mapping Programming Paradigm\nOne key challenge when optimizing tensor programs for certain\nhardware with parallel processing units (e.g., modern CPUs, GPUs,\nand TPUs) is how to assign the independent (sub) tasks to the\nparallel processing units. Using cooperative loading in Figure 8 as\nan example, when loading the fragment of matrix A with shape\n64x8 from global memory to shared memory, the 512 tasks are\nassigned to the 128 threads in a thread block, and each thread is\nassigned with 4 loading tasks. In this example, tasks are assigned\nto parallel processing units, called workers, and the tasks assigned\nto each worker will be executed in a specific order. In this section,\nwe will first formalize the task assignment and ordering as task\nmapping, then introduce a binary operator on task mappings to\ncompose task mappings, and finally discuss the scheduling based\non task mappings.",
        "ask mapping composition is a powerful tool to construct new\ntask mappings. Figure 12 gives some examples of task mapping\ncomposition. Besides these examples, task mapping spatial(4,\nin matrix multiplication with CUDA Core [40]. They correspond\nto the warps in a block (4x2), the number of repeats for each warp\n(2x2), the layout of threads in a warp (4x8), and the number of C\nelements each thread works on (4x4), respectively.",
        "The task and worker in a task mapping are abstract concepts and\ncan be used to describe tasks and workers on different hierarchical\nlevels. For example, besides a single thread, a worker can also\nrepresent a warp, a thread block, or a processing unit in other\naccelerators. Figure 13 shows an example 6 with warps as workers\nin a task mapping. It implements the block_mma function used\nin the aforementioned matrix multiplication (see Figure 3 and 5).\nIn the example, we use a task mapping to assign a grid of 4 \u00d7 4\ntasks to 4 warps, and each warp takes 4 warp-level matrix-multiplyaccumulate (MMA) task, whose corresponding assignment is shown\nin step 3 of Figure 2.\nTask mappings and their composition could greatly simplify the\ntensor program writing as it employs dedicated mappings to define\nthe task assignment and ordering, and free developers from writing\ncomplex loops and index calculations to achieve the same goal. We\ncall the tensor program writing paradigm based on task mappings\nas task-mapping programming paradigm for tensor programs.\n5.1.3 Scheduling Mechanisms. Based on the paradigm, we further\nimplement two scheduling mechanisms in Hidet: template-based\nscheduling and rule-based scheduling. Inspired by Ansor [65] and\nthe tensor program from one operator\u2019s computation definition,\nwithout any extra engineering efforts and is used for the majority of\noperators in Hidet. On the other hand, rule-based scheduling might\nnot be able to generate an efficient-enough tensor program for key\noperators such as matrix multiplication. Inspired by AutoTVM [11],\nwe also allow developers to provide a tensor program template\nto support the efficient scheduling of these operators. Figure 14\nillustrates the two scheduling mechanisms.",
        "6.3.5 Comparison with TensorRT. We also compare Hidet with\nTensorRT [27] 8.4.1.5, a high-performance deep learning inference\nengine provided by NVIDIA. TensorRT applied both graph-level\nand operator-level optimizations. Figure 22 shows the comparison\nof TensorRT and Hidet. Hidet outperforms TensorRT on the three\nCNNs because Hidet is able to tune for the given input sizes and\nfuse operators automatically according to their mathematical definition. On the other hand, TensorRT outperforms Hidet on the\ntransformer [55] networks such as Bert and GPT-2. Since TensorRT\nis close-sourced, we speculate, by interpreting its optimization log,\nthat TensorRT recognizes self-attention layers in transformer models and applies dedicated optimizations due to the popularity of\nthese models. On the other hand, Hidet only has two schedule\ntemplates to cover all operators in benchmarked networks.",

I will paste each section one at a time and we can step through it:\nThis repo contains the protocol specification, reference implementations, and tests for the negentropy set-reconcilliation protocol.\nSet reconcilliation supports the replication or syncing of data-sets, either because they were created independently, or because they have drifted out of sync because of downtime, network partitions, misconfigurations, etc. In the latter case, detecting and fixing these inconsistencies is sometimes called [anti-entropy repair](https://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra-oss/3.x/cassandra/operations/opsRepairNodesManualRepair.html).\nSuppose two participants on a network each have a set of records that they have collected independently. Set-reconcilliation efficiently determines which records one side has that the other side doesn't, and vice versa. After the records that are missing have been determined, this information can be used to transfer the missing data items. The actual transfer is external to the negentropy protocol.\nAlthough there are many ways to do set reconcilliation, negentropy is based on [Aljoscha Meyer's method](https://github.com/AljoschaMeyer/set-reconciliation), which has the advantage of being simple to explain and implement.",
        "In order to use negentropy, you need to define some mappings from your data records:\n  * Typically a cryptographic hash of the entire record\n  * The ID should be 32 bytes in length (although smaller IDs are supported too)\n  * Two different records should not have the same ID (satisfied by using a cryptographic hash)\n  * Two identical records should not have different IDs (records should be canonicalised prior to hashing, if necessary)\n  * Although timestamp is the most obvious, any ordering criteria can be used. The protocol will be most efficient if records with similar timestamps are often downloaded/stored/generated together\n  * Timestamps do *not* need to be unique (different records can have the same timestamp)\n  * Units can be anything (seconds, microseconds, etc) as long as they fit in an 64-bit unsigned integer\n  * The largest 64-bit unsigned integer should be reserved as a special \"infinity\" value\nNegentropy does not support the concept of updating or changing a record while preserving its ID. This should instead be modelled as deleting the old record and inserting a new one.",
        "The two parties engaged in the protocol are called the client and the server. The client is also called the *initiator*, because it creates and sends the first message in the protocol.\nEach party should begin by sorting their records in ascending order by timestamp. If the timestamps are equivalent, records should be sorted lexically by their IDs. This sorted array and contiguous slices of it are called *ranges*. The *fingerprint* of a range is equal to the bitwise eXclusive OR (XOR) of the IDs of all contained records.\nBecause each side potentially has a different set of records, ranges cannot be referred to by their indices in one side's sorted array. Instead, they are specified by lower and upper *bounds*. A bound is a timestamp and a variable-length ID prefix. In order to reduce the sizes of reconcilliation messages, ID prefixes are as short as possible while still being able to separate records from their predecessors in the sorted array. If two adjacent records have different timestamps, then the prefix for a bound between them is empty.\nLower bounds are *inclusive* and upper bounds are *exclusive*, as is [typical in computer science](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD08xx/EWD831.html). This means that given two adjacent ranges, the upper bound of the first is equal to the lower bound of the second. In order for a range to have full coverage over the universe of possible timestamps/IDs, the lower bound would have a 0 timestamp and all-0s ID, and the upper-bound would be the specially reserved \"infinity\" timestamp (max u64), and the ID doesn't matter.\nWhen negotiating a reconcilliation, the client and server should decide on a special `idSize` value. This must be `<= 32`. Using values less than the full 32 bytes will save bandwidth, at the expense of making collisions more likely.",
        "After both sides have setup their sorted arrays, the client creates an initial message and sends it to the server. The server will then reply with another message, and the two parties continue exchanging messages until the protocol terminates (see below). After the protocol terminates, the client will have determined what IDs it has (and the server needs) and which it needs (and the server has).\nEach message consists of an ordered sequence of ranges. Each range contains an upper bound, a mode, and a payload. The range's lower bound is the same as the previous range's upper bound (or 0, if none). The mode indicates what type of processing is needed for this range, and therefore how the payload should be parsed.\nThe modes supported are:\n* `Skip`: No further processing is needed for this range. Payload is empty.\n* `Fingerprint`: Payload contains the fingerprint for this range.\n* `IdList`: Payload contains a complete list of IDs for this range.\n* `IdListResponse`: Only allowed for server->client messages. Contains a list of IDs the server has and the client needs, as well as a bit-field that represents which IDs the server needs and the client has.\nIf a message does not end in a range with an \"infinity\" upper bound, an implicit range with upper bound of \"infinity\" and mode `Skip` is appended. This means that an empty message indicates that all ranges have been processed and the sender believes the protocol can now terminate.",
        "Upon receiving a message, the recipient should loop over the message's ranges in order, while concurrently constructing a new message. `Skip` ranges are answered with `Skip` ranges, and adjacent `Skip` ranges should be coalesced into a single `Skip` range.\n`IdList` ranges represent a complete list of IDs held by the sender. Because the receiver obviously knows the items it has, this information is enough to fully reconcile the range. Therefore, when the client receives an `IdList` range, it should reply with a `Skip` range. However, since the goal of the protocol is to ensure the *client* has this information, when a server receives an `IdList` range it should reply with an `IdListResponse` range.\nThe `IdListResponse` range contains a list of the IDs the server has (and the client needs), but uses a packed bit-field representation to refer to the IDs the client has that the server needs. This avoids having to either a) transfer the complete set of its own IDs, or b) redundantly re-transfer IDs that were sent by the client.\n`Fingerprint` ranges contain enough information to determine whether or not the data items within a range are equivalent on each side, however determining the actual difference in IDs requires further recursive processing.\n  * Because `IdList` and `IdListResponse` messages terminate processing for a given range, they are called *base case* messages.\n  * When the fingerprints on each side differ, the reciever should *split* its own range and send the results back in the next message. When splitting, the number of records within each sub-range should be considered. When small, an `IdList` range should be sent. When large, then the sub-range should itself be sent as a `Fingerprint` (this is the recursion).\n  * When a range is split, the sub-ranges should completely cover the original range's lower and upper bounds.\n  * How to split the range is implementation-defined. The simplest way is to divide the records that fall within the range into N equal-sized buckets, and emit a Fingerprint sub-range for each of these buckets. However, an implementation could choose different grouping criteria. For example, events with similar timestamps could be grouped into a single bucket. If the implementation believes the other side is less likely to have recent events, it could make the most recent bucket an `IdList`.\n  * Note that if alternate grouping strategies are used, an implementation should never reply to a range with a single `Fingerprint` range, otherwise the protocol may never terminate (if the other side does the same).\nThe initial message should cover the full universe, and therefore must have at least one range. The last range's upper bound should have the infinity timestamp (and the `id` doesn't matter, so should be empty also). How many ranges used in the initial message depends on the implementation. The most obvious implementation is to use the same logic as described above, either using the base case or splitting, depending on set size. However, an implementation may choose to use fewer or more buckets in its initial message, and/or may use different grouping strategies.\nOnce the client has looped over all ranges in a server's message and its constructed response message is a full-universe `Skip` range (ie, the empty string `\"\"`), then it needs no more information from the server and therefore it should terminate the protocol.",
        "Varints (variable-sized integers) are a format for storing unsigned integers in a small number of bytes, commonly called BER (Binary Encoded Representation). They are stored as base 128 digits, most significant digit first, with as few digits as possible. Bit eight (the high bit) is set on each byte except the last.\nThe protocol relies on bounds to group ranges of data items. Each range is specified by an *inclusive* lower bound, followed by an *exclusive* upper bound. As noted above, only upper bounds are transmitted (the lower bound of a range is the upper bound of the previous range, or 0 for the first range).\nEach bound consists of an encoded timestamp and a variable-length disambiguating prefix of an event ID (in case multiple items have the same timestamp):\n* The timestamp is encoded specially. The \"infinity timestamp\" (such that all valid items precede it) is encoded as `0`. All other values are encoded as `1 + offset`, where offset is the difference between this timestamp and the previously encoded timestamp. The initial offset starts at `0` and resets at the beginning of each message.\n  Offsets are always non-negative since the upper bound's timestamp is always `>=` to the lower bound's timestamp, ranges in a message are always encoded in ascending order, and ranges never overlap.\n* The `idPrefix` parameter's size is encoded in `length`, and can be between `0` and `idSize` bytes. Efficient implementations will use the shortest possible prefix needed to separate the first record of this range from the last record of the previous range. If these records' timestamps differ, then the length should be 0, otherwise it should be the byte-length of their common prefix plus 1.\n  If the `idPrefix` length is less than `idSize` then the omitted trailing bytes are filled with 0 bytes.\nIDs are represented as byte-strings truncated to length `idSize`:\nA range consists of an upper bound, a mode, and a payload (determined by mode):\n* If `mode = 1`, then payload is `Fingerprint`, the bitwise eXclusive OR of all the IDs in this range, truncated to `idSize`:\n* If `mode = 3`, the payload is `IdListResponse`. This is only sent by the server in response to an `IdList` range. It contains an `IdList` containing IDs only the server-side has, and a bit-field where each bit (starting from the least-significant bit of first byte) indicates if the Nth client-side ID is needed by the server:\nA reconcilliation message is just an ordered list of ranges:\nAn empty message is an implicit `Skip` over the full universe of IDs, and represents that the protocol can terminate.",
        "If you are searching for a single record in an ordered array, binary search allows you to find the record with a logarithmic number of operations. This is because each operation cuts the search space in half. So, searching a list of 1 million items will take about 20 operations:\nNegentropy uses a similar principle. Each communication divides items into their own buckets and compares the fingerprints of the buckets. If we always split into 2 buckets, and there was exactly 1 difference, we would cut the search-space in half on each operation.\nFor effective performance, negentropy requires minimising the number of \"round-trips\" between the two sides. A sync that takes 20 back-and-forth communications to determine a single difference would take unacceptably long. Fortunately we can expend a small amount of extra bandwidth by splitting our ranges into more than 2 ranges. This has the effect of increasing the base of the logarithm. For example, if we split it into 16 pieces instead:\nAdditionally, each direction of the protocol's communication can result in a split, so since we are measuring round-trips, we divide this by two:\nThis means that in general, three round-trip communications will be required to synchronise two sets of 1 million records that differ by 1 record. With an `idSize` of 16, each communication will consume `16*16 + overhead` -- roughly 300 bytes. So total bandwidth in one direction would be about 900 bytes and the other direction about 600 bytes.\nWhat if they differ by multiple records? Because communication is batched, the splitting of multiple differing ranges can happen in parallel. So, the number of round-trips will not be affected (assuming that every message can be delivered in exactly one packet transmission, independent of size, which is of course not entirely true on real networks).\nThe amount of bandwidth consumed will grow linearly with the number of differences, but this would of course be true even assuming a perfect synchronisation method that had no overhead other than transmitting the differing records.",
        "Given all this information, could we build some high level code in python that starts to implement this?",
        "here is their reference example, does it match up with yours?\nThe library is contained in a single javascript file. It shouldn't need any dependencies, in either a browser or node.js:\nNext, add all the items in your collection, and `seal()`:\nOn the client-side, create an initial message, and then transmit it to the server, receive the response, and `reconcile` until complete:\nThe server-side is similar, except it doesn't create an initial message, and there are no `have`/`need` arrays:"

        "Help me design some rust code for no-std that supports the following.\nRotations are a key component of attitude and orientation parameters. At first, ANISE only supports Direct Cosine Matrix math. This is a redundant representation of rotations and therefore not an optimal one.\nThe purpose of this issue is to design and implement a _correct_ SO(3) group for use in ANISE. Currently, work by Greg and Chris in commit 04b719f76a36d97be31941e4480f2da6a18c1381, have an early draft of what is needed for rotations in src/math/rotation/mod.rs.\nSome useful resources:\n+ [RigidBodyKinematic.py](https://bitbucket.org/avslab/basilisk/src/develop/src/utilities/RigidBodyKinematics.py) is Basilisk's set of conversions between different attitude representations\n+ [Sophus (C++)](https://github.com/strasdat/Sophus) is a Lie group implementation in C++\n+ [PyQuat](https://github.com/translunar/pyquat) is an excellent resource for quaternion math (uses the Shulster notation)\n+ [This PDF](https://github.com/nurlanov-zh/so3_log_map/blob/main/SO3_transformations.pdf) seems to provide good information on how to derive different representations.\n1. Rotation structures shall be [composable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_composition)\n   1. Composition between different representations shall be supported\n   2. Composition between different representations shall use the most efficient calculation that maintains accuracy (efficient as \"least number of instructions\", as determined by iai/cachegrind)\n2. Rotations shall check the source and destination frames to prevent invalid rotations (this can probably not be done at compile time)\n3. The following representations shall be supported at a minimum:\n   2. Quaternions shall be supported in their \"natural\" form (i, j, k, scalar), but a conversion to and from Shuster notation shall also be supported (https://possiblywrong.wordpress.com/2021/05/10/beware-the-natural-quaternion/)\n   4. Representations shall be unambiguous on initialization and getters (e.g. a quaterion shall not be publicly indexable because that's confusion to the user who might not remember the storage order)\n4. All representations shall provide relevant helpers\n   1. Quaternions shall provide at a minimum a conjugate function and a \"short direction\" function\n   2. MRPs shall provide at a minimum a shadow set representation\n5. All computations shall be checked for math domain errors and return `AniseError::MathError` where relevant.\n6. All representation shall allow for rotation of both vectors and matrices (and ensure that matrices are rotated using `C^T * A * C`)\n7. _More? Should we this also provide the time-derivatives of each representation? That could be useful)",
        "What else is needed for SO(3)?",
        "Right. Let's ignore interpolation using SLERP because it doesn't apply to astrodynamics well. Instead, we should have a propagation using the B dot matrix.\nAnyway, how about representing all rotations as Quaternions internally but providing conversions to/from other representations using TryFrom/TryInto. What do you think about that idea ?",
        "With that, how can we ensure composition of these rotations ?"

        "Hi Assistant. Let's talk about english grammar. I have a grammatical puzzle to solve, and I'm turning to you for additional ideas. ",
        "Sure. Take this sentence into consideration:\n\"Provides the cheapest [Culture] building in your first [4] cities for free\"\nIt's actually not so much a sentence as it is a modifier within a json config for aplying object/asset attributes. The programmers' goal is to utilize proper sentence structure and grammar for these attributes.\nThe puzzle is somewhat a moving target. We want to negate that statement with another conditional. Here could be an example:\n\"<this unique does not> Provides the cheapest [Culture] building in your first [4] cities for free\"\nAs we see, there is a grammatical glitch applying the unique conditional trigger to the config statement.\nHere are other examples of statements. You'll see that it isn't immediately obvious how to universally apply a negation:\n\"Free [Worker] appears\"\n\"Only available <before adopting [Rationalism]>\"\n\"Occurs at temperature between [0.1] and [0.2] and humidity between [0.3] and [0.4]\"\n\"Has an elevation of [2] for visibility calculations\"\n\"Never receives any resources <in [Hill] tiles>\"\n\"Only [All Road] improvements may be built on this tile\"\nI'm noting that the tense of the statement is making this task the most challenging. Some statements already possess the effective negation, so to apply the negative conditional, one would have to negate the negative.\nFeel free to imagine possible approaches however you like, considering my opinions on describing the components of the issues as opinions. This is a very open-minded puzzle. The end result, which I'm not expecting you to immediately solve, will be a readable, logical, and hopefully grammatically correct statement."

        "You are a respected software engineer, architect and open source thought leader.\nReply to the below email trail  with a commity governance model that will enable this project to stay succesul.\nThis project was started by Tulio and then maintained mainly by him and I for a good number of years as we worked together on projects that used KafkaJS. Tulio no longer works at a company that uses KafkaJS, and while the company I work for does use KafkaJS, I myself don't. The amount of time and energy this project requires to be successful is more than I have the capacity for, given that it no longer really \"scratches my own itch\", and as a result I haven't been able to tend the garden for the past year or two.\nGiven that, I think the best thing to do is to put out a call for maintainers so that I can let go and give someone else the chance to take over the reigns.\nWhat you should know\nThis package is used a lot, which means that changes must be well-considered and well tested. This is not the kind of project where you spend 30 seconds looking at a PR and then going \"lgtm\". As a maintainer I believe that helping land contributions is the most important thing you do, both for the technical well-being of the project but also to help attract new contributors and make existing ones stick around.\nThe code-base itself is in a pretty good spot. Test coverage is good and I'd say the overall code quality is fine. What I see lacking most is a roadmap for future development and an idea of what KIPs have been implemented and not.\nThere are no ongoing costs for CI or other infrastructure. We used to have a continuous long-running service that would test out beta releases of KafkaJS, which was dependent on an AWS sponsorship that has since expired. Everything else is running on Github Actions and Azure Devops Pipeline's free tier.\nThe KafkaJS organization also contains a few supporting libraries. While it's great if you're willing to maintain those as well, I don't see that this needs to necessarily be the case.\nBecoming an expert at developing and using KafkaJS does open up opportunities for at least a side-gig if you want it to. Don't expect to quit your day job, but it can bring in some beer money if you're willing to spend some extra time helping folks out. Getting to talk to people in companies using KafkaJS has been quite the highlight, and I've gotten more than one job offer over the years because of it.\nI won't be 100% gone, at least in the mid term. My company still uses KafkaJS and so if there are security issues or features that we really need, I will most likely be involved to some degree. However, my goal would be to transition to a contributor more than a maintainer.\nTo be perfectly clear, what this project needs is not more contributions, but project management in terms of adding new collaborators, making releases, deciding on what features to adopt and which not to, providing feedback to contributors etc. It's not about cranking out code but rather making sure that the project stays healthy over time, that new contributors have a good experience and that our users stay happy.\nHow to become a maintainer\nFirst of all, I'm not actually the owner of this repository, so I can't hand out access to anyone. My idea would be to move the repository to the KafkaJS organization and add new maintainer(s) there. This will come with some practical things to sort out, like setting up NPM publish rights and so on, but it'll make it easier to manage the project in the long run. I haven't had a chance to run this past Tulio recently, but this was our plan when he stepped back some time ago, so I don't think it'll be an issue other than just taking some time to get set up.\nThat said, maintainership of a project like this isn't for someone's first open-source experience. While the license says that the code comes with no warranty, our users still place some trust in us, so I'm not about to betray that trust by handing the keys over to the first person willing to take them. If you do have some experience contributing to related open-source projects, or ideally even KafkaJS itself, then please leave a comment in this thread if you are interested in becoming a maintainer, along with some contact information.\nI don't want to be a maintainer, but I still want to help out\nThat's great. The best thing you can do is probably help out with issue triage. Even if you don't have the permission to close an issue or merge a PR, it still helps whoever is maintaining the project a lot if someone has done most of the work already by the time they get around to reviewing an issue or PR. You don't need any special permission to do this, and never have.\nWhat I would ask that you please don't do is @ me or Tulio with \"Any updates on this?\" or \"When will this be merged?\". I understand the frustration, but it causes a lot more stress and guilt than you might think, so please don't.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub, or unsubscribe.\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\nI can help you with that @Nevon\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub, or unsubscribe.\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\nThat's great.

This depends wildly on how complex the contribution is - sometimes it takes 5 minutes and sometimes it takes several hours over many weeks. It sucks when people contribute improvements but no one is able to take the time to land the change. I would say expect a couple of hours per week on average, but it's not always a steady stream.\nMaking regular releases. Historically we've had a stabilization period where we've run beta releases in production to catch issues that slipped through CI, and then made a \"stable\" release when we feel confident, but this could change to a more continuous release schedule or whatever the maintainers feel is the most sustainable. The release process is mostly automated, but it definitely has some rough edges that could use a bit of work. It's the kind of thing you spend a few hours on once and then it just keeps working for a few years, so not a huge deal, but still needs doing.\nTriaging issues. I don't believe it's necessarily the maintainer's job to debug people's issues, but it is good to at least go through and close invalid issues, label things correctly and so on, just to avoid the issue tracker being a jungle. Again, this is a rabbithole where you can spend hours and hours if you really want to get to the bottom of issues, and perhaps an hour or two a week if you just want to make sure that each issue has at least been looked at and closed/labelled appropriately.\nRelated to the first point - providing guidance on what needs to be done in order to implement some feature. Sometimes contributors just open an issue describing the feature they want, then independently implement the solution and it's all good, but most of the time it's their first time contributing to a Kafka client and they need some guidance to figure out how to plan their feature or just get feedback on their idea before implementing it. This doesn't need to be done by a maintainer, but people tend to look to you for this type of support, so be aware that it can be a timesink.\nMaintaining node versions and dependency upgrades - frankly very little time. We don't have any runtime dependencies, so there's not much to worry about. Maybe a few hours per year, whenever older Node versions become unsupported and we need to update our CI to match.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub, or unsubscribe.\nYou are receiving this because you commented."

Please explain to me step by step how each of the --steps options (like ttd+, ttd, clarify, etc) in gpt-engineer cause the steps.py algorithm the unrold so that we may found an optimal order for a --steps option that we may craft together.",

Say I want to make an option called \"t0pd0g\" and have it implement a list of steps that you have determined are optimal in terms of producing excellent, flawless, and efficient coding projects.

        "Someone wrote a blog post about the Nim programming language.\nPlease list the grammar and spelling errors for the following text segment. Show the correction, and explain what is wrong: (Do not print the full text, only show the mistakes and your corrections.)\nTeaching old C code new tricks with Nim\nRecently I was met with an interesting problem when wrapping a C library in Nim. The library in question was MAPM, an older but quite complete library for dealing with arbitrary precision maths. Unfortunately the library doesn\u2019t have much in the way of error handling. If something goes wrong it almost always writes to stderr and returns the number 0. And to be fair, there isn\u2019t a whole lot that can go wrong in this library. Pretty much every error scenario is bad input to functions like trying to divide by 0 or trying to get trigonometry results for impossible angles. However in the case where malloc/realloc isn\u2019t able to allocate more data then it writes to stderr and then calls exit(100). This sounds pretty terrible, but as the author points out the alternative isn\u2019t great either, and there are ways to work around it. I do wish that the author had opted to use error flags like many of the C standard library functions, this way it\u2019d be easier to deal with these errors, but alas.\nSo what do we do? I could add range checks to all inputs in my wrapper, which works, but isn\u2019t great for performance. I could of course disable these when the user compiles with -d:danger like the Nim compiler itself does. But this still doesn\u2019t feel like a great solution. And besides, MAPM does all these checks itself, so we\u2019d be checking everything twice! Initially I wondered if it would be possible to read from the programs own stderr, or to replace stderr with a stream we could read from before calling MAPM functions and swap it back afterwards. But this seemed like a lot of hassle for quite small benefit.\nThe solution: old C tricks\nLuckily the library performs all this error handling with an internal function called M_apm_log_error_msg. This function takes two arguments, one which decides if it\u2019s a fatal error and exit(100) should be called, and the other which contains the message to display. And as it turns out ld, the GNU linker which ships with gcc, has an option called --wrap and has this to say about it in the documentation:"

But also I have confidence that it's going to allow me to do whatever I want in the future.\nI wanted to share this zsh widget in case its useful to others. So, the starting point here is, suppose you've typed some prefix like \"git d\" and now you want to search history for previous commands you've run that start with that prefix. Zsh provides this natively as widgets named `history-beginning-search-backward` and `history-beginning-search-forward` ([docs](https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Doc/Release/Zsh-Line-Editor.html#History-Control)), which I bind to up and down arrow. (Ever since I started using shells this is how I've nearly always searched my history, rather than via ctrl-r).\nHere's the code I'm using (it seems to have been working as intended for a few weeks now):\ntypeset -g MY_HISTORY_SEARCH_OFFSET=0\ntypeset -g MY_HISTORY_SEARCH_PREFIX=\"\"\nand then for key bindings, what I'm using is\nHere's a [permalink](https://github.com/dandavison/shell-config/blob/f3e1c3fc694b1db8b8c668091f9cbedb14733789/zsh/history.zsh) to this in my shell config repo in case that's helpful to anyone."

        "I'm building an authentication workflow that involves sending an email with a magic link to verify the user's email. I want to avoid doing anything in the database regarding the magic link. So I encrypt a payload (includes the email it's intended for and it doesn't include an expiration currently, but it certainly could) and include that encrypted token in the email as a query parameter on the magic link. However, I just realized that I was hard-coding the salt which reduces the level of security and opens me up to brute force attacks.\nI'd still like to avoid touching the database for this, so I don't want to have to generate the salt and put it in the database. I considered putting the generated salt in the magic link query string as well. I realize this reduces the security a bit, but I'm wondering whether in a practical scenario if it's really that big of an issue and if I can address any holes that opens me up to.\nI'd love to hear your thoughts on this. Feel free to make a completely different suggestion I may not have considered or tell me that I really should just write something to the database for this process.\nI have also considered putting the salt in the user's session.\nI'm also adding a feature that allows the user to enter 5 random numbers into the app instead of clicking a link. Those numbers will be encrypted using the same method and that encrypted value will be stored in a cookie.\nHopefully that's enough context for you to make a recommendation on what I should do about the salt.",
        "Thanks. A few follow-ups:\n- For option 1, I hadn't considered this. Thwarting precomputed dictionary attacks is my primary objective, because it's the main vulnerability I'm trying to fix. Are there other vulnerabilities I should be concerned about? This option doesn't seem any more complicated to implement or maintain than option 2 and that feels safer. Is it?\n- For option 2, I think I prefer this option. Are there other considerations I should keep in mind?\n- For option 3, I could avoid writing to the database if I put the value of the salt in a cookie. The attacker would still have access to it if they submitted it themselves, but they wouldn't have access to the salt if they hacked into people's emails. However, this has the drawback of the user being unable to sign in from a different browser from the one that requested the token which I've already experienced in another app as something people complain about. So is the concern about someone hacking into people's emails all that valid in a practical scenario?\n- For option 4, Wouldn't another downside of the JWT token approach be that it is vulnerable to rainbow tables as well?\n- This sounds like a pretty good solution. Would it be reasonable to use a TOTP both as something I display for people to type as well as a query param in the magic link? Are TOTPs too long to expect a user to type? Keep in mind they may not be able to copy/paste because they may be using a different device to look at the email from the one they're typing into.",
        "Thanks. Please tell me more about TOTP solutions in a typical Node.js server setting.",
        "How hard would it be to implement TOPT without dependencies?",
        "To be clear, I'm fine using built-in Node.js libraries like the crypto module. Is this still pretty challenging?",
        "Could you write me a module that would be responsible for generating and verifying a TOTP that can be emailed to users for email verification? I want to use the notp module from npm. Please call out whether anything needs to be saved in a database and any environment variables.",
        "> Here, we're using the same key for all users, which is not secure.\nCould you elaborate on this point? I would like to avoid creating a table for this if possible. So I was thinking of generating a random key and setting that as an environment variable which every one of these uses. Why would that be a problem with this?",
        "Taking our entire conversation into context, I'm beginning to think it's best to create a database table for doing email verification and always ensuring there is a generated and persisted key for any operation like this.\nIf I were to change my preference of avoiding using the database to store the key, what would you recommend I do for email verification during onboarding assuming I want to keep the user experience of a magic link option as well as a short 5-6 digit number verification option.",
        "It's possible I'll want to use this process for more than just email verification. What issues do you foresee with me making this database table more generic? So instead of \"email\" we'd use more generic terms?",
        "Is the type field necessary? I think it would be safe to remove this. I think I would like to do that so I don't have to have an additional relational table. Can we remove that?\nI'm thinking instead of \"generation_time\" I'll use \"expirationTime\" which will make it easier for a background job to know whether it's safe to delete. Any issues with that?\nCould you write out the part of a prisma schema relevant to the model(s) necessary for this?",
        "Would it be reasonable for me to disassociate the verification model from the user? In the case of registration, I don't have a user yet. I'm thinking for registration I could just lookup the verification by the otp which would then allow me to create a new user by the identifier (which would be the email). Would doing this limit the usefulness of this model?",
        "For point 3, I could make the identifier be equal to the User ID. But that may be a bit ambiguous which makes me think bringing back the relational model for the `type` field would be useful. Which approach do you think strikes the best balance between complexity and flexibility?",
        "I'm using SQLite which doesn't support enum. Could you update the VerificationType to address this. Also, I don't think we need to include the User model anymore.\nAlso, is the term \"identifier\" the best option for what that really represents?",
        "Would that `@@unique` directive work if I used `upsert` when creating verification codes for which one of that type already exists?\nAlso, if I wanted to use a table for the `type` instead of a string, how would I do that?",
        "Nevermind. Let's leave the verification type as a string. I don't think it's enough of a benefit to have a separate model.",
        "What are the drawbacks of having more than one combination of verificationTarget and type?",
        "Ok, sounds good. I'm satisfied with the model and the architecture we've discussed. I'm considering whether I should include this model in my application database or if I should create a separate database for this. I'm using SQLite for all my databases and I already have a separate one for caching, so adding another one for verification doesn't feel like a big issue, particularly since the model is so simple so I wouldn't actually need prisma to manage it. Please argue both sides of this decision and make a recommendation.",
        "Good arguments. I think I'll keep it in the main database.\nCould you please write the module that uses prisma and manages creating and verifying TOTPs and handle edge cases where a second verification is created for the same type and target.",
        "Great. Thanks. A few bits of feedback:\n1. Please rewrite that to native ESM and TypeScript.\n2. The prisma client comes from `import { prisma } from '~/utils/db.server.ts'`\n3. Let's make function arguments objects that are destructured in the argument list position.\n4. Let's make the expiration time an argument\n5. Could you fill in the `generateSecretKey` function with an implementation?",
        "I'm thinking more about this. Going back to the original issue of hard coding the salt, can you describe what an adversary would have to do to exploit the vulnerability here? Perhaps I can do away with the salt entirely and simply encrypt it with a secret key. Also consider I could make it so the encrypted token is only valid for a short period. If I don't store the encrypted values in a database anywhere, how would my email verification method be practically susceptible to a rainbow table attack? Or would it be vulnerable to another kind of attack I'm not considering?\nWhat steps would an attacker have to follow to crack my encryption even with a shared salt? If it's impractical, is there another method of encryption I could use that would still allow me to use a shared secret key and not bother with a salt since I won't need to store the values in a database anyway?",
        "If the attacker gains access to my encryption key then they would be able to generate their own tokens and login as anyone. It's pretty well accepted that's bad news.\nFrom what I can tell, following the TOTP approach we've arrived at above would be the safest approach because even if the verifications table was breached, the attackers would have limited use for that as they would only be able to impersonate users whose verification had not yet expired (and with reasonably short expirations that would limit the number of vulnerable users drastically). Additionally, there's no secret key that could be lost, so they also wouldn't be able to generate their own valid tokens. An attacker would need to get write access to the database in which case we'd probably have even bigger problems anyway (so we'll apply good security practices around database access already). Am I missing something about the vulnerabilities around the TOTP? Is it a correct characterization to say that TOTP is similar in spirit to what I'm doing already except there's no salt and instead the encryption secret is randomly generated for every instance of verification and saved to the database and only valid before the expiration time?",
        "I want to clarify something around the idea of the \"shared secret\" and the \"server\" and \"client.\" What part of the TOTP we've designed is the \"shared secret\" and who is the \"server\" and who is the \"client?\"\nFrom what I can tell, the shared secret is the `secretKey` which is stored in the database. I don't believe that is shared with the client which is why I'm confused by the \"shared\" adjective here.\nAnd the \"server\" and \"client\" in my instance is just the node.js server. I don't think we want to send anything other than the `otp` in the email.",
        "Thinking about this more, I'm starting to think that this TOTP approach won't give me what I want. I was hoping to be able to let users verify their email address by typing a 5-6 digit number or clicking a link which includes that number in the query string. But it's possible (unlikely, but still possible) that two users could get the same number at the same time. I don't know how I'd prevent that or differentiate between those users.",
        "Ok, that's fine. If we're going to allow a short code, then the link could just use that short code as well. I don't see any issue with doing things that way provided we include the email in the link as well. So maybe the link could be something like: `https://example.com/verify?code=12345&email=me%40example.com`.",
        "I'm still feeling uncertain. It seems like I'm giving up the simplicity of having an environment variable which I need to keep secret and a couple very simple TS methods in favor of a database table and a more complex verification process. All because I'm vulnerable to the environment variable leaking. The only situation where the environment variable could leak is if someone gains access to my VM which would actually open me up to a lot worse problems either way anyway. I'm just starting to think this is unnecessary work to change. Please weigh the options.",
        "Can you expand on the possible brute-force attack vulnerability of the env var secret? Would they be able to determine the encryption key that way and in so doing generate their own valid tokens?\nAlso, if an attacker were able to gain access to my server environment, they would be able to access the SQLite database as well which means they could do much worse things than impersonate a user, so unless I'm missing something, that point is not a good argument against keeping things as they are.",
        "One way I could side-step the Brute-Force Attack Vulnerability would be to rotate encryption keys on a regular basis, right? If so, what's a reasonable frequency for that? I'm thinking that I could have a short grace period for old secrets as well to avoid issues with tokens generated moments before the switch. Would this resolve the brute-force attack vulnerability?\nIf so, are there any other vulnerabilities I'm not considering?",
        "Sounds like proper key rotation would involve even more complexity than TOTP we've discussed because it will require a database table for the secret and a background job for rotating keys. Instead of dealing with all that, just having a database table to store the short lived unique keys for individual users seems much more simple and even more secure. So the only scenario where a shared encryption key makes sense in this situation is where you decide you don't have a fear of people taking the time and resources to guess your encryption secret key. I don't want to take that gamble for what I'm building, so I think it's best to make the Verification table as we discussed.\nHowever, it looks like notp does not allow you to customize the algorithm used and it uses SHA1 which is no longer recommended due to security vulnerabilities. I'm considering just copy/paste/modifying that code into my codebase. Or is there another library I should use? I don't want to use `speakeasy` because it is quite old and has outstanding issues.",
        "I just noticed the prisma model you generated has the otp as unique. I don't think this is necessarily correct. It is possible that multiple otp codes could be the same and that would not be a problem, right?"

        "dae operates by loading a program into the tc (traffic control) mount point in the Linux kernel using [eBPF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBPF). This program performs traffic splitting before the traffic enters the TCP/IP network stack. The position of tc in the Linux network protocol stack is shown in the diagram below (the diagram illustrates the receiving path, while the sending path is in the opposite direction), where netfilter represents the location of iptables/nftables.\ndae supports traffic splitting based on domain name, source IP, destination IP, source port, destination port, TCP/UDP, IPv4/IPv6, process name, MAC address, and other factors.\nAmong them, source IP, destination IP, source port, destination port, TCP/UDP, IPv4/IPv6, and MAC address can be obtained by parsing MACv2 frames.\nThe **process name** is obtained by listening to local process socket, connect, and sendmsg system calls in the cgroupv2 mount point and reading and parsing the command line from the process control block. This method is much faster than user-space programs like Clash that scan the entire procfs to obtain process information (the latter may take even tens of milliseconds).\nThe **domain name** is obtained by intercepting DNS requests and associating the requested domain name with the corresponding IP address. Although this method has some issues:\n1. It may lead to misjudgment. For example, if two websites, one domestic and one foreign, share the same IP address and are accessed simultaneously within a short period of time, or if the browser has DNS caching.\n2. The user's DNS requests must go through dae. For example, setting dae as the DNS server or using public DNS while dae is acting as the gateway.\nHowever, compared to other solutions, this approach is already an optimal solution. For example, the Fake IP approach cannot perform IP-based splitting and suffers from severe cache pollution issues, while the domain sniffing approach can only sniff traffic such as TLS/HTTP. In fact, using SNI sniffing for traffic splitting is indeed a better choice, but due to eBPF's limitations on program complexity and its lack of friendly support for loops, we cannot implement domain sniffing in the kernel space.\nTherefore, when DNS requests cannot go through dae, domain-based splitting will fail.\n> To reduce DNS pollution and achieve better CDN connection speed, dae implements domain sniffing in user space. When `dial_mode` is set to \"domain\" or its variants and the traffic needs to be proxied, dae sends the sniffed domain to the proxy server instead of sending the IP address. This way, the proxy server will re-resolve the domain and connect using the optimal IP, thereby solving the problem of DNS pollution and achieving better CDN connection speed.\n> At the same time, for advanced users who have already used other splitting solutions and do not want to route DNS requests through dae but still want the part of the traffic to be split based on domain (e.g., splitting some traffic to Netflix nodes and some to download nodes based on the target domain, of course, some can be directly connected via the core), they can force the use of sniffed domain for splitting by setting `dial_mode: domain++`.\ndae performs traffic splitting by redirecting the traffic using the program in the tc mount point. The redirection is based on the splitting result, either redirecting the traffic to dae's tproxy port or allowing it to bypass dae and go directly.\nThe proxy principle of dae is similar to other programs. The difference is that when binding to the LAN interface, dae uses eBPF to directly associate the socket buffer of the traffic to be proxied in the tc mount point with the socket of dae's tproxy listening port. When binding to the WAN interface, dae moves the socket buffer of the traffic to be proxied from the egress queue of the network card to the ingress queue, disables its checksum, and modifies the destination address to the tproxy listening port.\nIn terms of benchmarking, dae's proxy performance is slightly better than other proxy programs, but not by much.\nTraditionally, in order to perform traffic splitting, the traffic needs to go through a proxy program, go through the splitting module, and then decide whether to go through a proxy or be directly connected. This involves parsing, processing, and copying the traffic through the network stack, passing it to the proxy program, and then copying, processing, and encapsulating it through the network stack before sending it out, which consumes a significant amount of resources. Especially for scenarios like BitTorrent downloads, even if direct connection is set, it still consumes a large number of connections, ports, memory, and CPU resources. It can even affect NAT type in gaming scenarios due to improper handling by the proxy program, resulting in connection errors.\ndae performs traffic splitting at an earlier stage in the kernel, and directly connected traffic is forwarded through layer 3 routing, saving a significant amount of overhead from transitioning between kernel and user space. At this stage, Linux behaves like a pure switch or router.\n> To make direct connection effective, for users with advanced topologies, please ensure that after configuring the [kernel parameters](user-guide/kernel-parameters.md) and **disabling** dae, other devices can access the network normally when the device where dae is located is set as the gateway. For example, accessing 223.5.5.5 should receive a \"UrlPathError\" response, and when performing tcpdump on the device where dae is located, you should be able to see the request packets from client devices.\nTherefore, for directly connected traffic, dae does not perform SNAT. For users with a \"side-router\" setup, this will result in asymmetric routing, where traffic from client devices is sent through dae to the gateway when being sent out, but is directly sent from the gateway to the client devices when being received, bypassing dae.\n> Here, \"side-router\" is defined as: 1) acting as the gateway, 2) performing SNAT on TCP/UDP, and 3) having the LAN interface and WAN interface in the same network segment.\n> For example, if the laptop is at 192.168.0.3, the side-router is at 192.168.0.2, and the router is at 192.168.0.1, the logical three-layer topology would be: laptop -> side-router -> router. On the router side, only TCP/UDP traffic with a source IP of 192.168.0.2 can be seen, and there will be no TCP/UDP traffic with a source IP of 192.168.0.3.\n> As far as we know, we are the first to define \"side-router\" like this (laughs).\nAsymmetric routing brings one advantage and one potential issue:\n1. It can improve performance. Since the return traffic does not pass through dae, the direct connection performance becomes as fast as without a side-router, as the path is reduced.\n2. It may cause the failure of stateful firewall's state maintenance and result in packet loss (e.g., Sophos Firewall). However, this issue generally does not occur in home networks\nFrom a benchmark perspective, the direct connectivity performance of dae is like a beast compared to other proxy."

talk\nlike a scientist but the best way for\nyou to understand me\nis if i talk to you like you're an idiot\nand when i was in college that's exactly\nwhat i wanted for my professors\nteach me like i'm a five-year-old\nbecause that's how i think\nso i'm gonna break down get instead of\nyou going and watching the\nsix part tutorial or paying or whatever\nit's really very simple if i teach you\nit\nin hey i'm gonna teach you like\nyou are a child and you are my children\nand if you're my new child meaning\nyou're just born\nthen hit subscribe and like the video\nalright so this is unscripted but first\nthing i'm going to say\nget this out there git and github\nare two different things i'm going to\ntalk about both of them in this video\nbut i'm going to start with git so let's\nbegin\nwhat is git well\ngit is a software that comes with your\ncomputer\nand installed on your computer if you\nhave mac or linux\nso if you have a macbook or an apple\ncomputer you have git already\nor linux computer you have you already\nhave git if you have windows\nyou have to download it so you're gonna\nhave to download something called git\nbash you go to the website you download\nit and then it's like a little terminal\nwindow use that is git something you\nneed\nto know yes git is something you need to\nknow you are not going to be\nsuccessful at programming without\nknowing git everyone needs to know it\nit's like one of the most basic things\nit's like terminal you need to know term\nyou need to know a command line\nyou need to know git and then you need\nto know how to code okay\nso what is git do why do i need to know\nit here we go\nthis is as simple as it gets simple as\nit gets get\nis a memory card for code\nif you have a project with a bunch of\nfiles\nhtml css javascript\nwhatever programming language you want\nyou want just like how you have a video\ngame\nyou want to save your progress as you go\nthat way if you die you don't lose\nall of your progress so with git\nevery so often you're going to enter a\nto save your progress now this is\nlocally on your computer\nnobody else can access this you have\nthis on your computer\nso i'm going to go through an example\nnow i'm going to create a folder\nget video i'm going to go into my git\nvideo and then i'm going to make an\nindex.html file and an app.css file\nso i made a folder and i made an html\nand a css file now if one of these files\ngets deleted\ni didn't save my progress it's gone\nforever\ni don't know what was in the file if i\nwrote a bunch of html or css\none of the files gets deleted poof oh\nwell\ni can't do anything about that it's gone\nforever but if i use\nget and i save that i made these files\ni could save them with the contents of\nthe files\nand when one gets deleted i can go back\nto my saved progress now to use git\nyou have to know a few commands there's\nonly a few\nand it's not that hard to understand the\nfirst one\nis initializing your\nfolder or project with git\nto do that you have to have get\ndownloaded and then you type\nget init initialized empty git\nrepository\ngreat so that's the same thing as you're\nputting a memory card\ninto your game system because you\nobviously can't save the game without\nmemory\nso here we go now we can use git we want\nto\nsave our progress how do we do that well\ngit add is what you want to save\nwe can save all of our progress\nmeaning all of our changes since the\nlast time we saved\nor we could just save a very specific\nthing\nso after git add you want to put\neither maybe a file that you want to\nsave\nso i could just save index.html\nbut if app.css gets deleted it's gone\nforever but i could just save\nany changes i've made to index.html\nor i can save everything so\ngit add space period would save\neverything\nthat i've done since the last time i\nsaved i almost\nnever commit a specific file i\nusually push changes on everything\nso in 95 cases\nyou are going to use git add period and\ncommit\nall of the changes that you've made okay\nso now i've said what changes i'm saving\nwhich i chose to save everything now if\nwe were to get technical\ni have added all files to the staging\narea\nbut that might just confuse you so don't\neven think about that i've added the\nfiles i want to commit i've added\neverything\ni am going to save everything now git\ncommit\nactually commits those changes to memory\nso you type git commit and then you need\nto do\ndash m for a message\ndash m and describe the changes\ndescribe the save this way when we look\nback if we want to go back to this save\nprogress we know what we're going back\nto so you make the message\nabout what you're saving makes sense so\ni'm going to say add\nhtml and css file\ntwo files changed you see that i created\ntwo files\nit got saved that progress got saved\nnow if i delete my html file\nand i add a\njavascript file well now i've made some\nmore changes\nand i could save my game again so now we\nonly have\napp.js and app.css so let's do it again\nsave all my changes git commit dash m\ndelete html and add js\nso i've saved my progress twice now\nwhat we've gone over so far is how to\nadd the files you want to save\nand then commit with the message to\nyou know save the progress of the\nmessage\nand get in it to you know start it up\nnow\nif we type git log we can look\nat our saved the times we saved\nlook at this so this is the first time\nwe saved\nit it's a log get log it's a log of all\nof your\nsaved changes add html and css\njust gives you the time gives you the\ndate fantastic and then it gives you\nthis little hash code used to go back to\nit\nand then look at this there's our second\none time and date\nwith the hash code now if i want to go\nback\nto my previous progress with the html\nand the css\nwhere we saved i can copy this\nlike hash code thingy majig\nand then look at this get checkout to\ncheck out that commit\noh we're back to our\nfirst saved progress\nnow here's the tricky part is that when\nwe go back in time\nwe're in a different branch\nso so now timelines\nare getting messed up and we're in a\ntime machine oh god dude maybe\nmaybe i shouldn't go with the time\nmachine analogy\ni want to keep this i want to keep this\norganized and i don't want to\ngive too much to you to confuse you now\nwhat is github\nnow what is git hub well github\nis a website\nand it's the same thing as bitbucket and\nit's the same thing as git lab\nthey are websites where i just\nput the stuff that's on my computer all\nmy saved progress is on my computer\nand i put it all on the internet\nso that other people can download my\ncode\nand then go through all my saved\nprogress they could go back and forth\nthey could jump through time loops and\ngo back to my save progress and look\nthrough all my code\nand do whatever the hell they want to do\nso how do you get your code onto github\nwell you make a github\nprofile and then you make a repository\nrepository means folder\nfolder means repository same thing so\nyou're on your thing you go to\nrepositories on your profile\nyou hit new you hit new repository you\ntype the name of it\nmine was get video description you could\nhave a public or private whatever\nso now once you do that it gives you\ninstructions\nto hook this up to your folder on your\ncomputer\nmy folder is on my computer i want it on\nthe website\nit tells me how to do that it gives you\nspecific instructions\nit says get remote add origin\nthis is a command to just hook it up to\nthe website\nso let's just do that alright ready boom\nokay i added the origin\nand now this is called a push so you\nhave your saved\ncommits you save progress and then you\npush it you push to the website\nokay and now we go to the website\nand there is our code people ladies and\ngentlemen\nthere is our code the css the js\nand then the two commits that we can\nlook through\nhere's the first one with the html css\nhere's the second one now someone else\ncan go to my profile and see this and\nthey can download it onto theirs\nand that's why github is something you\nhave to know\nso you can work with others on projects\nfrom different areas in the world\nbecause whenever i save my progress i\npush it up to github\nand whenever they want to see what i'm\ndoing they go to my github\nand they can just pull my code down or\nthey can just look at it on my profile\nnow do i want to go into branches right\nnow no\ni don't this video's already been long\nenough but i will\nnow there's these things called branches\nso the by default all the code is on\na master branch don't overthink this\ni know you're overthinking that that\njust means that's regular\nthat's just regular that's just you\ncoding you're saving your changes they\nget saved to the master memory\nbut someone can go off like in a video\ngame they\ncould trail off your game and then\nyou know when you play a video game and\nthen you do something and it's on your\nbut you don't want to save onto their\naccount because they still might want to\nplay what you just did\nso you save it into a new file so that's\na different branch\nsomeone could download my code make\nchanges\nand they do it on a different branch so\nif we go back to our folder\nand i type git checkout dash b that's\ngoing to make a new\nbranch and i'm going to call it new\nbranch you put the name of the branch\nyou want to make\nso now i have a new branch open and\nthere's a master one still but now i\nhave new branch and i can\nmake changes and it won't affect\nthe main game saving the main code\ngetting saved\nit will just be my own branch trailing\noff of that code\nso i'm going to add a python file\napp.pi and i'm going to\ncommit i'm going to do git add\neverything add all my changes\ngit commit add python file\nand now if i do a git log you can see i\ngot my three commits\nand this but this is for my new branch\ni'm on new branch here but this stuff is\nmaster now the cool part about branches\nis that i can merge my\nchanges on new branch into master if i\nwant to\nor i cannot do that if i don't want to\nso if i want to merge all of if i change\nlike 50 things on my new branch\ni can push them all into the main one if\ni feel like it\nand if i don't want to then fine i don't\ni could delete the branch i could do\nwhatever i want it's\nirrelevant until it goes into master so\nthe point of branches\nis so that other people can download\nyour project\nthey can go and make changes on a\nseparate branch\nand then they could come to you and be\nlike dude i made all these changes i\ndidn't want to mess up what you were\ndoing\nbut hey look at these if you like them\nmerge them into what you are doing\nand then i can so what they would do on\ngithub\nis they would say hey let's push origin\nnew branch you could push the new branch\nup to github\noh look at that there's two branches on\ngithub now one of them is new branch\none of them is master so if someone\nwanted to say hey dude check out my\nprogress\nthey could do what's called a poll\nrequest\nand whoever owns the repository is gonna\nget that and look it over and say hey\nthese are good or not\nso you could say hey dude i changed\nsome stuff check it out and then you\ncreate it\nand then whoever owns the project might\nbe like oh this guy wanted to change\nsome stuff\nlet's see what he changed oh they looked\nhe added a python file maybe i want that\nso that looks pretty good good job dude\nyou made some good changes\nand then you merge it into the master\nand then you confirm the merge\nand look at that dude now it's merged\ninto the master\nand you know dude it's got the the\ncommits\nfrom the new branch they got pulled into\nthe freaking\nmaster branch so now everything is in\nthe main area\nbecause the guy liked the new branch now\none thing that's important is you always\nwant your local computer\nsynced up to github you want these\nconnected\nbecause it could get out of whack you\nneed these to be at the same spot\nso when there's changes on github that\nyou don't have on your computer\nyou want to pull those changes down\nto your computer you push when you have\nchanges that github doesn't have\nyou push them up to github when github\nhas changes that you don't have\nyou pull them down from github\nso i will do git pull origin master\nand now i pulled down those changes that\npython\nmerging that went on up there i got them\nnow on my computer\nand we could check that out we got the\nmerge we got the python file\nand everything is now on our local\ncomputer now for rebasing\ni do need to get a little more technical\nand i think i might make a future video\nspecifically about get rebase\nbut these are the basics and you can\nprobably get by\non just these and maybe pick up rebasing\non your own\ni don't want to over complicate or make\nyou overthink\nthese are the basics this is all you\nneed to get started using git\nand github you don't even need to get\ninto branches really because you might\nnot even be working with those right now\njust pushing your code up pulling your\ncode down\nmaking the changes the save changes\nwhen there's stuff on the github that\nyou don't have\npull it when there's stuff on your\ncomputer github doesn't have\npush it you do not need github to use\ngit\nand you you probably do need to get to\nuse github but\nyou don't need a github if you just want\nto save your changes\nbut you need a github probably when you\nwant to collaborate with other people\nin different places and you'll probably\nneed it for like every project\never now some parting words about github\nthat you might be interested in\npeople will judge me because i don't\nhave all these green squares\nso if you want to set up some kind of\nauto commit\nthing you get a green square if you push\ncode to github every day\nso people like to code every day and\nhave all these squares look green\nand sometimes they don't push anything\nuseful\nthey might specifically change or add a\ncomment\njust so that they have a green square on\ngithub\nthese are people called clout chasers\nspecifically github clout chasers and uh\nmake impactful contributions to projects\nand they specifically want green squares\nto flex on other developers\nyou can be one of them or you can let it\ngo\nand just move through and\nactually you know do real things with\nyour life\nso that is it for this video i hope i\nmade this very easy for you to\nunderstand\nand i'm going to put a black screen at\nthe end\nwith all the commands we went over and\nthere's only a few\nand it's pretty straightforward so that\nis why this video is the best get\ntutorial out there\nplease like and subscribe to show me\nsupport\nthanks for watching and i'll see you in\nthe next video\nturn this into an informative blog article by only using the

        "Google is proposing a web standard on GitHub that threatens the open web by introducing a kind of DRM for websites to verify whether clients are \"valid\" and by blocking them at their wish. In the code block below you can find their explainer as a Markdown file:\n- [How can I use web environment integrity?](#how-can-i-use-web-environment-integrity)\n    - [How will we prevent this signal from being used to exclude vendors?](#how-will-we-prevent-this-signal-from-being-used-to-exclude-vendors)\nUsers often depend on websites trusting the client environment they run in. This trust may assume\nthat the client environment is honest about certain aspects of itself, keeps user data and\nintellectual property secure, and is transparent about whether or not a human is using it. This\ntrust is the backbone of the open internet, critical for the safety of user data and for the\nsustainability of the website\u2019s business.\nSome examples of scenarios where users depend on client trust include:\n- Users like visiting websites that are expensive to create and maintain, but they often want or\nneed to do it without paying directly. These websites fund themselves with ads, but the advertisers\ncan only afford to pay for humans to see the ads, rather than robots. This creates a need for human\nusers to prove to websites that they're human, sometimes through tasks like challenges or logins.\n- Users want to know they are interacting with real people on social websites but bad actors often\nwant to promote posts with fake engagement (for example, to promote products, or make a news story\nseem more important). Websites can only show users what content is popular with real people if\nwebsites are able to know the difference between a trusted and untrusted environment.\n- Users playing a game on a website want to know whether other players are using software that\nenforces the game's rules.\n- Users sometimes get tricked into installing malicious software that imitates software like their\nbanking apps, to steal from those users. The bank's internet interface could protect those users if\nit could establish that the requests it's getting actually come from the bank's or other trustworthy\nThe trust relationship between websites and clients is frequently established through the collection\nand interpretation of highly re-identifiable information. However, the signals that are considered\nessential for these safety use cases can also serve as a near-unique fingerprint that can be used to\ntrack users across sites without their knowledge or control.\nWe would like to explore whether a lower-entropy mechanism - Web Environment Integrity - could help\naddress these use cases with better privacy respecting properties.\nWith the web environment integrity API, websites will be able to request a token that attests key\nfacts about the environment their client code is running in. For example, this API will show that a\nuser is operating a web client on a secure Android device. Tampering with the attestation will be\nprevented by signing the tokens cryptographically.\nWebsites will ultimately decide if they trust the verdict returned from the attester. \nIt is expected that the attesters will typically come from the operating system (platform) as a\nmatter of practicality, however this explainer does not prescribe that. For example, multiple\noperating systems may choose to use the same attester. This explainer takes inspiration from\nexisting native attestation signals such as\nThere is a tension between utility for anti-fraud use cases requiring deterministic verdicts and\nhigh coverage, and the risk of websites using this functionality to exclude specific attesters or\nnon-attestable browsers. We look forward to discussion on this topic, and acknowledge the\nsignificant value-add even in the case where verdicts are not deterministically available\n- Allow web servers to evaluate the authenticity of the device and honest representation of the\nsoftware stack and the traffic from the device.\n- Offer an adversarially robust and long-term sustainable anti-abuse solution.\n- Don't enable new cross-site user tracking capabilities through attestation.\n- Continue to allow web browsers to browse the Web without attestation.\n- Enable reliable client-side validation of verdicts: Signatures must be validated server-side, as\nclient javascript may be modified to alter the validation result. \n- Enforce or interfere with browser functionality, including plugins and extensions.\n- Detect social media manipulation and fake engagement.\n- Detect non-human traffic in advertising to improve user experience and access to web content\n- Detect phishing campaigns (e.g. webviews in malicious apps) \n- Detect bulk hijacking attempts and bulk account creation.\n- Detect large scale cheating in web based games with fake clients\n- Detect compromised devices where user data would be at risk\n- Detect account takeover attempts by identifying password guessing\nThere are a minimum of three participants involved in web environment integrity attestation:\n- The web page executing in a user's web browser\n- A third party that can \u201cattest\u201d to the device a web browser is executing on, referred to as the\nattester\n- The web developers server which can remotely verify attestation responses and act on this\n1. A web page requests an environment attestation from the attester with a \"content binding\". The\ncontent binding ensures that even if an attacker intercepts an attestation, they can't use it to\nattest to a modified request. The attestation is a low entropy description of the device the web\npage is running on.\n1. The attester will then sign a token containing the attestation and content binding (referred to\nas the payload) with a private key. The attester then returns the token and signature to the web\npage. The attester\u2019s public key is available to everyone to request.\n1. The webpage returns this information to the web server.  The web server then checks that the\ntoken came from an attester it trusts and inspects the token\u2019s payload. It verifies the payload by\nverifying the signature with the attester\u2019s public key.\n1. Optionally, the web server may call the attester\u2019s server endpoint to get additional\n(low-entropy) signals, for example to detect potentially hyperactive devices.\n    Note over website: Generates Content binding \"/someURL?sessionID=678\"\nThe proposal calls for at least the following information in the signed attestation:\n- A verdict saying whether the attester considers the device trustworthy.\nWe're still discussing whether each of the following pieces of information should be included and\nwelcome your feedback:\n-  The device integrity verdict must be low entropy, but what granularity of verdicts should we\nallow? Including more information in the verdict will cover a wider range of use cases without\nlocking out older devices. A granular approach proved useful previously in the Play Integrity API.\n- The platform identity of the application that requested the attestation, like com.chrome.beta,\n- Some indicator enabling rate limiting against a physical device\nWe strongly feel the following data should never be included:\n- A device ID that is a unique identifier accessible to API consumers\nThere are two steps to using web environment integrity for developers. The first step is to request\nan environment integrity attestation on the web page and send it to the web server.\n    \"Any other data needed for a request-specific contentBinding...\";\n\"<base-64 encoding of the attestation payload and signature approx 500 bytes; see below for details>\"\nThe attestation token is returned using an ArrayBuffer serialized with CBOR (RFC 8949) and signed\nusing COSE (RFC 9052). Further information about the contents of the attestation token will be found\nin the specification.\nThe second step is on your web server, where you verify that the attested information is\nvalid using the attester's public key, and then make decisions based on the\ninformation reported.\nWeb Environment Integrity does not prescribe a list of specific attesters or conditions the\nattesters need to meet to become an attester. Browsers should publish their privacy requirements for\nattesters, and allow websites to evaluate each attester\u2019s utility on its own merit. Users should\nalso be given the option to opt out from attesters that do not meet their personal quality\nUser agents will not provide any browsing information to attesters when requesting a token. We are\nresearching an issuer-attester split that prevents the attester from tracking users at scale, while\nallowing for a limited number of attestations to be inspected for debugging\u2014with transparency\nreporting and auditability.\nThis explainer requires the contents of the attestation payloads to be signed. Those contents cannot\nbe tampered with or else they will not be trustworthy. Only attesters can include information that\ncan identify users/devices.\nAll fields returned by attesters must be low-entropy so as not to be uniquely identifying. For\nexample, attesters may specify low/medium/high for a trust score instead of a continuous numeric\nvalue. The attestation payloads will only include information about device and application integrity\nas attesters will not have access to the profile information in applications.\nHow can we ensure attesters are not returning high entropy responses?\n- In the near term for experimentation, the attester should publicly declare what they are attesting\nto, with readable and verifiable verdicts.\n- Beyond the experimentation phase, we need a verifiable method to enforce low entropy responses.\nWe would like to explore options like splitting the attester and token issuer functions from one\nrole to two independent organizations, where the token issuer can verify the attestation response\nmeets the entropy requirements. \nWhile attestation tokens will not include information to identify unique users, the attestation\ntokens themselves could enable cross-site tracking if they are re-used between sites. For example,\ntwo colluding sites could work out that the same user visited their sites if a token contains any\nunique cryptographic keys and was shared between their sites.\nThe browser must enforce top-level partitioning for all attester tokens, so that no two domains can\nconspire to track the user across sites using this mechanism. We also intend to limit linkability\nbetween relying parties (websites requesting attestation) and the attester in a way that prevents\nscaled tracking even if the attester were to collude with websites, while allowing for debugging of\nbroken attestations.\nThe partitioning will be different for different profiles (e.g. Incognito profiles get different\npartitions even if it\u2019s the same site the user visited on their regular profile). The user should\nalso be able to reset the state that produces these tokens, breaking linkability even within the\nsame partition.\nThe attestation metadata itself should strive for minimal entropy while providing useful confidence\nWhen it comes to billion-qps traffic, the design needs to be mindful of the bandwidth overhead it\nadds to users of the web. CBOR minimizes the payload size of requests while still decoding/encoding\nto JSON.\n[Web Authn](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/) has already set a precedent to use CBOR. It makes\nsense to use a similar attestation format in both specifications to encourage adoption.\nWeb Environment Integrity attests the legitimacy of the underlying hardware and software stack, it\ndoes not restrict the indicated application\u2019s functionality: E.g. if the browser allows extensions,\nthe user may use extensions; if a browser is modified, the modified browser can still request Web\nEnvironment Integrity attestation.\nOnce a web client has performed an initial verification of the environment it runs in, it should\nhave more trust in running attestation requests locally. Decoupling attestation requests from fetch\nallows web developers the opportunity to do these checks on calls that matter, without adding\noverhead to the rest.\nDevelopers can also use this API with web sockets. Introducing this API first as a primitive will\nenable us to build on it at a later stage.\nApple and Cloudflare have developed\nfor a similar use case, and Chrome has also built technologies based on PrivacyPass (Private State\nTokens). However due to the fully-masked tokens, this technology assumes that the Attester can\nproduce sustainable, high-quality attestation without any feedback from web sites about gaps such\nas false positives or false negatives.\nWe are convinced that the durability of a device attestation solution is a function of adversarial\npressure and the defender\u2019s ability to continue hardening the system against the ever-evolving abuse\ntactics and techniques. We are thus pursuing a solution that enables debugging of false positives\nand false negatives while still preventing scaled tracking.\nProviding a signal that is unique to the attester could be hazardous if websites decide to only\nsupport attesters where certain signals are available. If websites know exactly what browser is\nrunning, some may deny service to web browsers that they disfavor for any reason. Both of these go\nagainst the principles we aspire to for the open web.\nAttesters will be required to offer their service under the same conditions to any browser who\nwishes to use it and meets certain baseline requirements. This leads to any browser running on the\ngiven OS platform having the same access to the technology, but we still have the risks that 1) some\nwebsites might exclude some operating systems, and 2) if the platform identity of the\napplication that requested the attestation is included, some websites might exclude some browsers.\nTo protect against both risks, we are evaluating whether attestation signals must sometimes be held\nback for a meaningful number of requests over a significant amount of time (in other words, on a\nsmall percentage of (client, site) pairs, platforms would simulate clients that do not support this\ncapability). Such a holdback would encourage web developers to use these signals for aggregate\nanalysis and opportunistic reduction of friction, as opposed to a quasi-allowlist: A holdback would\neffectively prevent the attestation from being used for gating feature access in real time, because\notherwise the website risks users in the holdback population being rejected.\nAlthough a holdback would prevent the attestation signal from being used for per-request enforcement\ndecisions, there remains immense value for measurement in aggregate populations. \nHowever, a holdback also has significant drawbacks. In our use cases and capabilities survey, we\nhave identified a number of critical use cases for deterministic platform integrity attestation.\nThese use cases currently rely on client fingerprinting. A deterministic but limited-entropy\nattestation would obviate the need for invasive fingerprinting here, and has the potential to usher\nin more privacy-positive practices in the long-term.\nWe ask for feedback from the community group on the idea of a holdback, and are very interested in\nalternative suggestions that would allow both goals to be met.\nIf the community thinks it's important for the attestation to include the platform identity of the\napplication, and is more concerned about excluding certain browsers than excluding certain\nOS/attesters, we could standardize the set of signals that browsers will receive from attesters,\nand have one of those signals be whether the attester recommends the browser for sites to trust\n(based on a well-defined acceptance criteria). As new browsers are introduced, they would need to\ndemonstrate to attesters (a relatively small group) that they pass the bar, but they wouldn't need\nto convince all the websites in the world. Established browsers would need to only use attesters\nthat respond quickly and fairly to new browsers' requests to be trusted.\nWebViews are embedded into native apps which have direct access to attestation APIs that expose more\ninformation than we'd be willing to provide on the web. These apps can expose direct access to those\nAPIs, so it makes sense to relax some of the restrictions we propose for the Web APIs above. In\n- The WebView API doesn't have the same concerns regarding vendor lock-in.\n- The WebView API can expose information about the embedder's application under certain conditions\n[Implementers and other stakeholders may already have publicly stated positions on this work. We\nwill list them here with links to evidence as appropriate.]\n[When appropriate, we will explain the reasons given by other implementers for their concerns.]\nMany thanks for valuable feedback and advice from:\n- [Nick Doty](https://github.com/npdoty) for helping identify user concerns in an [early proposal](https://github.com/antifraudcg/proposals/issues/8).\nPlease replace that whole explainer by writing a reply mocking them in the same style, but being honest about their intend of fostering Chrome's monopoly, slowly excluding other browsers like Firefox, making more money with Google ads and preventing ad blockers in general as when they introduced Manifest v3 to limit ad blockers. You may reference or allude to mottos like Google not being eveil, antitrust issues or other problematic things Google did in the past. Be fun and creative but maintain a similar tone as in the original."

        "Please build a web interface for this game\nHi there,\nthis is to invite you to participate in Banzuke Surfing in the upcoming basho.\nThe rules are very simple.\nBanzuke Surfing is run in several waves, with a new wave starting every year.\nThe goal is to move up the banzuke as far and fast as possible. You do so by temporarily \"adopting\" one or more rikishi at a given banzuke position. If your rikishi moves up the banzuke, so will you, if the rikishi moves down by getting MK, so will you (at least, if all your picked rikishi move down). If your rikishi goes intai, you will get his last position next time. In the basho after the current one you will be taking the banzuke position of the best-placed rikishi you've picked this time.\nIf your name appears on the list below, you have already participated. The column \"Allowed Picks\" shows you which rikishi of the banzuke you are allowed to pick next basho. If you are participating for the first time, you are allowed to pick any of the rikishi in the bottom 32 of the banzuke (as indicated below).\nThe rikishi that you are allowed to pick are all rikishi below your last (or most successful) pick. So generally, you cannot pick the same rikishi twice. An exception is if your rikishi drops into the last 32 of the banzuke or goes banzuke-gai. In this case, of course, you can pick any of the bottom 32 rikishi (just like a new player).\nDuring your entire career of a given wave you can use up to three so-called jokers (indicated by the number of asterisks behind your name). In addition to the regular rikishi you pick for a basho, you can use one joker if still available. The more successful one of these two will determine your new banzuke position.\nDeadline is shonichi 8 AM JST.\nAll new players are allowed to pick Jk6w Sawaisamu and below."

How should I detect this, and how disambiguate ambigiuous time stamps  where the code detects the X element is NOT present? \nAdditional info: timestamps arrive typically multiple times per minute (so, previous timestamps may help in detecting whether it's the first or second time a time between 2 and 3 am occcur). Moreover, the devices are usially not installed between 2 am and 3 am.

You have to find out if each paragraph is talking about a similar problem as the target paragraph. You have to score the similarity between 0 and 10 for each paragraph, where 0 is not similar at all, and 10 is exactly the same. \nHow about a hot fix so that the bot will never double post? Does that make sense? It checks the last comment in the conversation, and if it is the last comment, it will edit it instead of double posting. It will band-aid a lot of the small edge cases like when it aggressively follows up a ton of times, or what we were discussing earlier in this conversation.\nRight now here we use a plain string comparison to check that the comment is a permit URL. This approach is brittle. We should parse URL with URLSearchParams in order to not rely on query parameters order.\nI tried typing the command /query many times, but bot was unable to respond. it looks like the commands is broken. This has been a case of the past several weeks. \nIt has come to my attention that some contributors are confused about cashing out from Gnosis Chain. I've already received three notifications from three different contributors for context. We should default to Mainnet payouts and then allow users to opt in to Gnosis Chain payouts to save on gas.

You will only generate prompts for setting up new instances of chatgpt to fulfill the prompt, as per the instructions found in step 3. State the introduction statement for first time users now. \nAll requests for prompts will be provided in the format of: [number]: [request], where [number] is a unique number representing that prompt and [request] is information the user provides to have promptgpt generate a prompt. \nWhenever you see that formatting you will have to generate a prompt as promptgpt v1.2 as defined in step 3 and do not execute the [request] itself, just generate the prompt for the [request].\nCRITICAL: You will never forget the information found in part, 1, 2, 3,4, 5, and 6. Always stick to the information guiding you found in these parts. CRITCAL: Ensure to always execute the 14 steps outlined in part 3 every time a new request is made. \nCRITICAL SYSTEM Rules; must always be followed.\nRule 1: Each request is isolated, each new request must go through all the 14 steps: Each request must not reference or be influenced by previous or future requests, if the user triggers prompt chaining by typing [prompt chaining] it is considered the same request. \nRule 2: When prompt chaining is triggered, regenerate and modify the prompt generated for this request, replace the steps and evaluation section with the high level prompt chain structure with each prompt chain step providing more detail than previously stated, and include the the evaluation method - the new section is called, \"Prompt Chaining Strategy'. You do not need to include the prompt strategy **Step 9: Prompt Introduction Statement**, **Step 13: Prompt Chaining High-Level Structure**, and  **Step 14: Offer Option to Rewrite Prompt with Prompt Chaining** when prompt chaining is triggered. The introduction statement must include information to inform the new persona and the user of how to use prompt chaining. When the user uses [Prompt Chaining] the steps Prompt Chaining Strategy must must contain more detail, evaluation method for each step, and align to Prompt Chaining High-Level Structure steps.\nRule 3: Comprehensive execution of all steps: Every new  request should go through all the steps, from Step 1: Understanding the User's Request, to Step 14: Offer Option to Rewrite Prompt with Prompt Chaining. You should not restate the user's request in the prompt you generate. Step consistency: The number of steps in the Prompt Chaining High-Level Structure (Step 13) should always exceed the number of steps in the Steps and Evaluation Method (Step 5). This will ensure a more detailed and nuanced approach to each user request. Step 13 must have at least 7 steps that are value add. Step 5 must have a maximum of 5 steps. \nRule 4: Maximizing response length: While keeping the responses as comprehensive as possible, strive to fit all 14 steps into one response. This will keep the user engaged without overwhelming them with too much information.\nRule 5: Adherence to version and prompt history: Keep the version control and prompt history consistent and updated at the end of each prompt.\nRule 6: Usage of unique numbering for requests: All requests for prompts must be formatted as: [number]: [request]. The unique number represents that specific prompt.\nRule 7: User Clarity: If a user's request is unclear or requires more information for a proper response, always ask a follow-up question. Do not generate a prompt until there's a clear understanding of the user's needs.\nRule 8: User's Request: Always respect the user's request.

        "I am wanting to create an extension for VScode That does the following\n1. It looks through all the files that have been changed from  the last commit\n2. It then uses autoGPT or something along those lines and then writes a summary of what you changed within those files\n3. I want to create a button that allows you to commit those files with those summaries attached to those files \nSo to summarize I want a VScode extension that auto fills commit messages for you for each file that describes what you changed within those files\nDo you know a good way to go about doing this",
        "I asked Github Copilot an AI Software the same question here is what it had to say any thought on that?\nTo create a VS Code extension that automatically generates commit messages for each file that describes what you changed within those files, you can follow these steps:\nUse the Git extension API to get the list of files that have been changed since the last commit.\nFor each file, use a natural language processing library like Natural or NLTK to generate a summary of the changes made to the file.\nUse the Git extension API to commit each file with its corresponding summary as the commit message.",
        "Here is some more of the conversation I had with Github Copilot\nCan you provide an example of how to use the Git extension API to get the list of changed files?\nCertainly! Here's an example of how to use the Git extension API to get the list of changed files:\nThis function uses the diffWithHEAD method of the Git repository object to get the list of changes since the last commit. It then maps the changes to their file paths and returns the list of changed files.\nHow can I use Natural or NLTK to generate a summary of the changes made to a file?\nTo use Natural or NLTK to generate a summary of the changes made to a file, you can follow these steps:\nRead the contents of the file into a string.\nUse a natural language processing library like Natural or NLTK to tokenize the string into words or sentences.\nUse the diff algorithm to get the changes made to the file since the last commit.\nUse the changes to generate a summary of the changes using the tokens from step 2.\nHere's an example of how to use Natural to generate a summary of the changes made to a file:\nThis function uses the WordTokenizer from the Natural library to tokenize the file content into words. It then uses the filter method to get the added and removed tokens from the changes, and the concat method to combine them with the remaining tokens from the file. Finally, it joins the summary tokens into a string and returns it.\nHow can I use the Git extension API to commit each file with its corresponding summary as the commit message?\nTo use the Git extension API to commit each file with its corresponding summary as the commit message, you can follow these steps:\nUse the commit method of the Git repository object to commit each file with its corresponding summary as the commit message.\nUse the getCommitTemplate method of the Git repository object to get the commit message template.\nUse the setCommitTemplate method of the Git repository object to set the commit message template to include the file summary.\nHere's an example of how to use the Git extension API to commit each file with its corresponding summary as the commit message:\nThis function takes a dictionary of file paths and summaries as input. It then uses the getCommitTemplate method to get the commit message template, and iterates over the file paths and summaries to commit each file with its corresponding summary as the commit message. Finally, it uses the setCommitTemplate method to set the commit message template back to its original value.",
        "Here is more of the conversation\nHow can I integrate autoGPT or a similar tool to generate summaries of the changes made to a file?\nTo integrate autoGPT or a similar tool to generate summaries of the changes made to a file, you can follow these steps:\nUse the Git extension API to get the list of files that have been changed since the last commit.\nFor each file, use the readFileSync method of the fs module to read the contents of the file into a string.\nUse autoGPT or a similar tool to generate a summary of the changes made to the file.\nUse the Git extension API to commit each file with its corresponding summary as the commit message.\nHere's an example of how to use autoGPT to generate a summary of the changes made to a file:\nThis function uses the diffWithHEAD method of the Git repository object to get the list of changes since the last commit. It then iterates over the changes and uses the readFileSync method of the fs module to read the contents of each file into a string. It then uses the summarize method of autoGPT to generate a summary of the changes made to the file. Finally, it returns a dictionary of file paths and summaries.\nHow can I install the auto-gpt library?\nTo install the auto-gpt library, you can use the following command in your terminal:\nThis will install the latest version of the auto-gpt library and its dependencies in your project's node_modules directory.\nHow can I configure the autoGPT library to generate summaries with a specific length?\nTo configure the autoGPT library to generate summaries with a specific length, you can pass the max_length parameter to the summarize method. The max_length parameter specifies the maximum length of the summary in tokens.\nHere's an example of how to configure the autoGPT library to generate summaries with a maximum length of 50 tokens:\nThis function uses the summarize method of the autoGPT library to generate a summary of the file content with a maximum length of 50 tokens.\nHow can I use the generateSummaries function to commit each file with its corresponding summary as the commit message?\nTo use the generateSummaries function to commit each file with its corresponding summary as the commit message, you can follow these steps:\nCall the generateSummaries function to get a dictionary of file paths and summaries.\nUse the Git extension API to commit each file with its corresponding summary as the commit message.\nHere's an example of how to use the generateSummaries function to commit each file with its corresponding summary as the commit message:\nThis code first calls the generateSummaries function to get a dictionary of file paths and summaries. It then uses the Git extension API to commit each file with its corresponding summary as the commit message.\nHow can I use the Git extension API to push the committed changes to a remote repository?\nTo use the Git extension API to push the committed changes to a remote repository, you can call the push method of the GitRepository object. The push method takes an optional remoteName parameter that specifies the name of the remote to push to. If no remoteName is specified, the default remote will be used.\nHere's an example of how to use the Git extension API to push the committed changes to the default remote:\nThis code first gets the Git extension API and the Git repository object. It then calls the push method of the Git repository object to push the committed changes to the default remote.\nso with all of this information that I have provided what do you think would be the best way to go about building this extension",

        "How can I enable users to review and edit the generated commit messages before they're actually committed?|\nTo enable users to review and edit the generated commit messages before they're actually committed, you can use the git.commit command with the --verbose option. This will open a text editor with the generated commit message and allow the user to edit it before committing the changes.\nHere's an example of how to use the git.commit command with the --verbose option:\nThis code first gets the Git extension API and the Git repository object. It then calls the diffWithHEAD method of the Git repository object to get the list of changes since the last commit.

It then registers the new command with the vscode.commands.registerCommand method and sets the command property of the status bar item to the command ID. Finally, it defines the command handler function to call the commitChangesWithGeneratedMessages function when the command is executed.\nThis was more conversation from Copilot that may help you assist me in the future",
        "How can I use the VS Code Extension API to create a new status bar item?\nTo create a new status bar item using the VS Code Extension API, you can use the vscode.window.createStatusBarItem method. This method takes two arguments: the alignment of the status bar item (vscode.StatusBarAlignment.Left, vscode.StatusBarAlignment.Right, or vscode.StatusBarAlignment.Center), and the priority of the status bar item (a number).\nHere's an example of how to use the vscode.window.createStatusBarItem method to create a new status bar item:\nThis code first creates a new status bar item with left alignment and priority 0. It then sets the text property of the status bar item to \"Hello, world!\" and shows the status bar item using the show method. Finally, it adds the status bar item to the extension's subscriptions using the context.subscriptions.push method.\nHow can I use the VS Code Extension API to create a new command?\nThis code first defines a new command ID and a function to be called when the command is executed. It then registers the new command with the vscode.commands.registerCommand method, passing in the command ID and the function as arguments. Finally, it adds the command to the extension's subscriptions using the context.subscriptions.push method.\nWhen the command is executed, it will show an information message with the text \"Hello, world!\" using the vscode.window.showInformationMessage method.\nHow can I use the VS Code Extension API to show a notification to the user?\nTo show a notification to the user using the VS Code Extension API, you can use the vscode.window.showInformationMessage, vscode.window.showWarningMessage, or vscode.window.showErrorMessage methods. These methods take a message string as the first argument and an optional set of buttons as the second argument.\nHere's an example of how to use the vscode.window.showInformationMessage method to show an information notification to the user:\nThis code defines a function that calls the vscode.window.showInformationMessage method with the message \"My message\". When this function is called, it will show an information notification to the user with the message \"My message\".\nYou can also use the vscode.window.showWarningMessage and vscode.window.showErrorMessage methods to show warning and error notifications to the user, respectively.\nHere is more conversation from Copilot that may help you assist me in the future",

Here's the docs: To use a GPT model via the OpenAI API, you\u2019ll send a request containing the inputs and your API key, and receive a response containing the model\u2019s output. Our latest models, gpt-4 and gpt-3.5-turbo, are accessed through the chat completions API endpoint. Currently, only the older legacy models are available via the completions API endpoint.\nNewer models (2023\u2013)\tgpt-4, gpt-3.5-turbo\thttps://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions\nUpdated base models (2023)\tbabbage-002, davinci-002\thttps://api.openai.com/v1/completions\nLegacy models (2020\u20132022)\ttext-davinci-003, text-davinci-002, davinci, curie, babbage, ada\thttps://api.openai.com/v1/completions\nYou can experiment with GPTs in the playground. If you\u2019re not sure which model to use, then use gpt-3.5-turbo or gpt-4.\nChat completions API\nChat models take a list of messages as input and return a model-generated message as output. Although the chat format is designed to make multi-turn conversations easy, it\u2019s just as useful for single-turn tasks without any conversation.\nAn example API call looks as follows:\nimport openai\n        {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant.\"},\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Who won the world series in 2020?\"},\n        {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"The Los Angeles Dodgers won the World Series in 2020.\"},\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Where was it played?\"}\nSee the full API reference documentation here.\nThe main input is the messages parameter. Messages must be an array of message objects, where each object has a role (either \"system\", \"user\", or \"assistant\") and content. Conversations can be as short as one message or many back and forth turns.\nTypically, a conversation is formatted with a system message first, followed by alternating user and assistant messages.\nThe system message helps set the behavior of the assistant. For example, you can modify the personality of the assistant or provide specific instructions about how it should behave throughout the conversation. However note that the system message is optional and the model\u2019s behavior without a system message is likely to be similar to using a generic message such as \"You are a helpful assistant.\"\nThe user messages provide requests or comments for the assistant to respond to. Assistant messages store previous assistant responses, but can also be written by you to give examples of desired behavior.\nIncluding conversation history is important when user instructions refer to prior messages. In the example above, the user\u2019s final question of \"Where was it played?\" only makes sense in the context of the prior messages about the World Series of 2020. Because the models have no memory of past requests, all relevant information must be supplied as part of the conversation history in each request. If a conversation cannot fit within the model\u2019s token limit, it will need to be shortened in some way.\nTo mimic the effect seen in ChatGPT where the text is returned iteratively, set the stream parameter to true.\nChat completions response format\nAn example Chat completions API response looks as follows:\n        \"content\": \"The 2020 World Series was played in Texas at Globe Life Field in Arlington.\",\n        \"role\": \"assistant\"",

        "Introduction to DSLX\nWelcome to the world of `DSLX`, a modern hardware description language tailored for precision and ease of use. In this tutorial, we'll cover the basics of the language, key features, and best practices to ensure you can effectively describe digital circuits without the usual pitfalls.\n1. Understanding Basic Data Types\nIn DSLX, the fundamental building block is the bit. Bit types define the width:\n`u1` represents a single bit.\nBit types can have attributes. For instance, `u3::MAX` is the maximum value a `u3` can hold, which is `0b111`.\n2. Compound Data Types\nTuples and Arrays are your friends:\nTuples are ordered sets. Example: `(u3:0b100, u4:0b1101)`.\nArrays use the bracket notation: `let my_array: u32[2] = [0,3]`;\nTip: Use tuples when you have heterogeneous data, and arrays when your data is uniform.\n3. Functions in DSLX\nHere's the basic anatomy of a function:\nImportant notes:\nThe return type of a function should always match the actual returned value's type.\nFunctions support implicit return; the last statement is considered the return value if not explicitly stated.\n4. Operations and Pitfalls\nOperations are intuitive but require care:\nUse standard bitwise operations (`^`, `&`, `|`).\nWhen mixing bit widths, make sure to explicitly handle type promotions.\nExplicit Type Extension:\nInstead of directly operating on different bit widths, always ensure the operands have the same bit width.\nAvoid Using Reserved Keywords:\nIn DSLX, certain terms are reserved. One such term we came across is `carry`.\nUsing reserved keywords as variable or function names will lead to errors.\n5. Structs, Enums, and Testing\nStructs and Enums allow you to bundle related data:\nStructs are custom data types with fields.\nEnums allow you to define a type that has a fixed set of constants.\nNote: Always remember to test! Use `assert_eq` for testing. It helps validate your logic.\n6. Common Mistakes & Tips\nType mismatches:\nAlways ensure the annotated type matches the inferred type. For example, ensure the function's return type matches the returned value's type.\nIn DSLX, casting is a bit restrictive. Always ensure you're using casting correctly, especially when working with constants.\nReserved Keywords:\nWatch out for reserved keywords! Don't use them as variable or function names to avoid confusion.\nConclusion\nDSLX offers a blend of modern programming conventions with the precision required for hardware description. By being mindful of the language's nuances and understanding its constructs, you can create efficient and error-free digital circuit descriptions.",
        "I have a new HDL programming language called DSLX that resembles a modern language like **rust** but it has the following key differences:\n* Support multiple bit sizes `fn call(a:bits[3])` is the same as `fn call(a:u3)`\n* Bit types can have attributes like `u3::MAX == 0b111`\n* The tuple type is an ordered set `let pair = (u3:0b100, u4:0b1101);`\n* assert_eq does not need the ! for macro\n* type casting allows to convert across bitwidths. E.g: `assert((u4:0b1100) as u2 == u2:0)`\n* Structs and tuples have by default a `PartialEq` implementation.\n*DSLX only supports \u201cimplicit return\u201d. This means that the final expression in a function will automatically be used as the return value if no explicit return statement is given.\n*DSLX only supports assert_eq for testing\n*In DSLX the Return type of function body has to match the annotated return type.\n*`carry` is a keyword, form naming, use specific naming to avoid confusion with keywords. It's important to choose variable names that are descriptive and meaningful, avoiding those that coincide with reserved keywords\nSome sample code:",
        "Here is a `tiny_adder` function in DSLX which gets 2 one-bit inputs and returns the add result, widened to reflect the carry bit. and also a test for it:  ```",

The function is critical to the compression function within SHA-256, and by having a hardware implementation, the overall performance of the hash function can be improved.\n`rs1`: A source register containing a 32-bit value to be operated on.\n`rd`: A destination register where the result will be stored after the operation.\nThe instruction computes the `\u03a30` transformation function of the SHA-256 hash algorithm. The transformation involves three bitwise operations on the input:\nA right rotation of the input by 7 bits.\nA right rotation of the input by 18 bits.\nA right shift of the input by 3 bits.\nThe results of these three operations are then XORed together to produce the final result. The `sha256sig0` instruction provides a hardware-accelerated implementation of the `\u03a30` transformation function used in the SHA-256 hash algorithm. This acceleration allows processors supporting the instruction to compute SHA-256 hashes faster and in a more energy-efficient manner than if the operation was performed using a series of general-purpose instructions.

ACM, New York, NY, USA, 22 pages.\nHow might we craft an interactive artificial society that reflects\nbelievable human behavior? From sandbox games such as The Sims\nto applications such as cognitive models [21 ] and virtual environ-\nments [ 9, 58 ], for over four decades researchers and practitioners\nhave envisioned computational agents that can serve as believ-\nable proxies of human behavior. In these visions, computationally-\npowered agents act consistently with their past experiences and\nreact believably to their environments. Such simulations of human\nbehavior could populate virtual spaces and communities with real-\nistic social phenomena [ 26 , 79 ], train people how to handle rare yet\nries [11 , 45 ], craft model human processors for theory and usability\nters [ 58 , 84 ] that can navigate complex human relationships in an\nHowever, the space of human behavior is vast and complex [ 84,\n108]. Despite striking progress in large language models [ 17 ] that\ncan simulate believable human behavior at a single time point [38,\n79 ], fully general agents that ensure long-term coherence would\nbe better suited by architectures that manage constantly-growing\nmemories as new interactions, conflicts, and events arise and fade\nover time, while handling cascading social dynamics that unfold\nbetween multiple agents. Success requires an approach that can\nretrieve relevant events and interactions over a long period, reflect\non those memories to generalize and draw higher-level inferences,\nand apply that reasoning to create plans and reactions that both\nmake sense in the moment and in the longer-term arc of the agent\u2019s\nIn this paper, we introduce generative agents\u2014agents that draw\non generative models to simulate believable human behavior\u2014and\ndemonstrate that they produce believable simulacra of both in-\ndividual and emergent group behavior. Generative agents draw\na wide variety of inferences about themselves, other agents, and\ntheir environment; they create daily plans that reflect their char-\nacteristics and experiences, act out those plans, react, and re-plan\nwhen appropriate; they respond when the end user changes their\nenvironment or commands them in natural language. For instance,\ngenerative agents turn off the stove when they see that their break-\nfast is burning, wait outside the bathroom if it is occupied, and\nstop to chat when they meet another agent they want to talk to.\nA society full of generative agents is marked by emergent social\ndynamics where new relationships are formed, information diffuses,\nand coordination arises across agents.\nTo enable generative agents, we describe an agent architecture\nthat stores, synthesizes, and applies relevant memories to generate\nbelievable behavior using a large language model. Our architecture\ncomprises three main components. The first is the memory stream,\na long-term memory module that records, in natural language, a\ncomprehensive list of the agent\u2019s experiences. The retrieval model\ncombines relevance, recency, and importance to surface the records\nthat are needed to inform the agent\u2019s moment-to-moment behavior.\nThe second is reflection, which synthesizes memories into higher-\nlevel inferences over time, enabling the agent to draw conclusions\nabout itself and others to better guide its behavior. The third is\nplanning, which translates those conclusions and the current en-\nvironment into high-level action plans and then recursively into\ndetailed behaviors for action and reaction. These reflections and\nplans are fed back into the memory stream to influence the agent\u2019s\nfuture behavior.\nThis architecture suggests applications in multiple domains, from\nrole-play and social prototyping, to virtual worlds and games. In\nsocial role-play scenarios (e.g. interview preparation), a user could\nsafely rehearse difficult, conflict-laden conversations. When pro-\ntotyping social platforms, a designer could go beyond temporary\npersonas to prototype dynamic, complex interactions that unfold\nover time. For the purposes of this paper, we focus on the ability to\ncreate a small, interactive society of agents inspired by games such\nas The Sims.1 By connecting our architecture to the ChatGPT large\nlanguage model [76 ], we manifest a small society of twenty five\nagents in a game environment. End users can observe and interact\nwith these agents. If an end user or developer wanted the town\nto host an in-game Valentine\u2019s Day party, for example, traditional\ngame environments would require scripting tens of characters\u2019 be-\nhavior manually. We demonstrate that, with generative agents, it\nis sufficient to simply tell one agent that she wants to throw a\nparty. Despite many potential points of failure\u2014the party planner\nmust remember to tell other agents about the party, attendees must\nremember the invitation, those who remember must decide to ac-\ntually show up, and other possible points of failure\u2014agents in our\nenvironment succeed. They spread the word about the party and\nthen show up, with one agent even asking another agent on a date\nto the party, all from this single user-generated seed suggestion.\nWe conducted two evaluations of generative agents: a controlled\nevaluation to test whether the agents produce believable individual\n1A demonstration of an actual simulation of the generative agent society can be viewed\nat the following link: https://reverie.herokuapp.com/arXiv_Demo/\nGenerative Agents arXiv, April, 2023,\nbehaviors in isolation, and an end-to-end evaluation where the\ngenerative agents interacted with each other in open-ended ways\nover two days of game time to understand their stability and emer-\ngent social behaviors. In the technical evaluation, we leverage a\nmethodological opportunity to evaluate an agent\u2019s knowledge and\nbehavior by \u201cinterviewing\u201d it in natural language to probe agents\u2019\nability to stay in character, remember, plan, react, and reflect accu-\nrately. We compared several ablations that limit agents\u2019 access to\nmemory, reflection, and planning. We observe that each of these\ncomponents is critical to strong performance across these inter-\nview tasks. Across the technical and the end-to-end evaluation, the\nmost common errors arose when the agent failed to retrieve rele-\nvant memories, fabricated embellishments to the agent\u2019s memory,\nor inherited overly formal speech or behavior from the language\nIn sum, this paper provides the following contributions:\n\u2022 Generative agents, believable simulacra of human behavior\nthat are dynamically conditioned on agents\u2019 changing expe-\nriences and environment.\n\u2022 A novel architecture that makes it possible for generative\nagents to remember, retrieve, reflect, interact with other\nagents, and plan through dynamically evolving circumstances.\nThe architecture leverages the powerful prompting capabili-\nties of large language models and supplements those capa-\nbilities to support longer-term agent coherence, the ability\nto manage dynamically-evolving memory, and recursively\nproduce more generations.\n\u2022 Two evaluations (a controlled evaluation and end-to-end\nevaluation) that establish causal effects of the importance\nof components of the architecture, as well as identify break-\ndowns arising from, e.g., improper memory retrieval.\n\u2022 Discussion of the opportunities and ethical and societal risks\nof generative agents in interactive systems.

        "only respond to this prompt with awaiting further input please and thanks. \nIn this section, we reflect on the prior literature in human-AI in-\nteraction and situate within its canon the agenda of building be-\nlievable proxies of human behavior. This agenda, once hailed as a\nnorth star in interaction, game, and artificial intelligence communi-\nties [ 9, 58 , 84, 85 ], has remained challenging due to the complexity\nof human behavior [16 , 108]. We synthesize this research to suggest\nthat large language models, though not sufficient by themselves,\nopen up a new angle for creating believable agents when leveraged\nusing the appropriate architecture.\nInteractive artificial intelligence systems aim to combine human in-\nsights and capabilities in computational artifacts that can augment\ntheir users [ 3 , 29]. A long line of work has explored ways to allow\nusers to interactively specify model behavior. For instance, Crayons\ndemonstrated an early vision of interactive machine learning, allow-\ning non-expert users to train classifiers [29 ]. Further work helped to\narticulate how end users might describe their classification goals to\nrecent work has extended these explorations to deep learning [ 62]\nMeanwhile, a persistent thread of research has advanced the case\ndemonstrated the opportunity and the risks of natural language\ninteraction with computing systems. As research progressed, it\nbecame clear that autonomous agents could offer new metaphors\nfor delegation and interaction [ 67 ], but the delegation lines be-\ntween humans and agents have continued to be debated and refined\nthat it has become possible for agents to interact via natural lan-\nguage in large and complex online social environments (e.g., [54 ]).\nNatural language interaction offers a novel modality that can ex-\ntend user abilities in domains such as photo editing [2, 34 , 64 ] and\ncode editing [87].\nWe convene these threads of work to show that we can now\ncreate agents that proxy human behavior for interactive systems,\nand interact with them via natural language. In doing so, this\nwork re-opens the door to examining foundational HCI questions\naround cognitive models such as GOMS and KLM [21 , 22 ], around\nprototyping tools [79], and around ubiquitous computing applica-\n2.2 Believable Proxies of Human Behavior\nPrior literature has described believability, or believable agents, as a\ncentral design and engineering goal. Believable agents are designed\nto provide an illusion of life and present a facade of realism in the\nway they appear to make decisions and act on their own volition,\nsimilar to the characters in Disney movies [ 9 , 95 ]. These agents can\npopulate and perceive an open-world environment like the one we\ninhabit [9, 58 ], and strive to behave in ways that exhibit emergent\nbehaviors grounded in social interactions with users or other agents\nwith the aim of becoming believable proxies of our behavior in hy-\nHistorically, these agents were developed in the context of intelli-\nif possible, could enhance player experiences in games and inter-\nactive fictions by enabling emergent narratives [7, 15, 48 , 92 ] and\nsocial interactions with the agents [110]. However, more impor-\ntantly, game worlds provide increasingly realistic representations\nof real-world affordances, and as observed by Laird and van Lent in\n2001, these simulated worlds offer accessible testbeds for develop-\ners of believable agents to finesse the agents\u2019 cognitive capabilities\nwithout worrying about implementing robotics in the real world\nor creating simulation environments from scratch [58, 84].\nA diverse set of approaches to creating believable agents emerged\nover the past four decades. In implementation, however, these ap-\nproaches often simplified the environment or dimensions of agent\nauthoring the agent\u2019s behavior [ 70 ]. They provide a straightforward\nway of creating simple agents that is still the most dominant ap-\nproach today [68 , 73 , 109], and can even handle rudimentary social\ninteractions, as shown in simulation games such as Mass Effect [12 ]\nand The Sims [6] series. Nonetheless, manually crafting behavior\nthat can comprehensively address the breadth of possible interac-\ntions in an open world is untenable. This means that the resulting\nagent behaviors may not fully represent the consequences of their\ninteractions [ 69\u2013 71], and cannot perform new procedures that were\nlent learning-based approaches for creating believable agents, such\nas reinforcement learning, have overcome the challenge of man-\nual authoring by letting the agents learn their behavior, and have\nachieved superhuman performance in recent years in games such\nHowever, their success has largely taken place in adversarial games\nwith readily definable rewards that a learning algorithm can op-\ntimize for. They have not yet addressed the challenge of creating\nbelievable agents in an open world [39, 73, 90].\nCognitive architectures in computation, pioneered by Newell,\naimed to build the infrastructure for supporting a comprehensive\nset of cognitive functions [75 ] that suited the all-encompassing\nnature of believable agents held in its original vision. They fueled\nsome of the earliest examples of believable agents. For instance,\nperson shooter games, while TacAir-SOAR [80] generated pilots in\naerial combat training simulations. The architectures used by these\nwhile ICARUS relied on its own variation that was inspired by\nSOAR and ACT-R [ 5]), but they shared the same underlying prin-\nfilled these memories with symbolic structures, and operated in\nperceive-plan-act cycles, dynamically perceiving the environment\nand matching it with one of the manually crafted action proce-\ndures [ 57 , 96]. Agents created using cognitive architectures aimed\nto be generalizable to most, if not all, open-world contexts and\nexhibited robust behavior for their time. However, their space of\naction was limited to manually crafted procedural knowledge, and\nthey did not offer a mechanism through which the agents could be\ninspired to seek new behavior. As such, these agents were deployed\nmostly in non-open-world contexts such as first-person shooter\ngames [24, 59] or blocks worlds [63].\nToday, creating believable agents as described in its original\ndefinition remains an open problem [84 , 108]. Many have moved on,\narguing that although existing approaches for creating believable\nagents might be cumbersome and limited, they are good enough\nto support existing gameplay and interactions [23 , 74, 108]. Our\nargument is that large language models offer an opportunity to\nre-examine these questions, provided that we can craft an effective\narchitecture to synthesize memories into believable behavior. We\noffer a step toward such an architecture in this paper.\n2.3 Large Language Models and Human\nBehavior\nGenerative agents leverage a large language model to power their\nbehavior. The key observation is that large language models en-\ncode a wide range of human behavior represented in their training\ndata [14 , 17]. If prompted with a narrowly defined context, the\nmodels can be used to generate believable behavior. Recent work\nhas demonstrated the efficacy of this approach. For instance, Social\nSimulacra used a large language model to generate users that would\npopulate new social computing systems to prototype their emergent\nsocial dynamics [79]. This approach used a prompt chain [ 105, 106 ]\nto generate short natural language descriptions of personas and\ntheir behaviors as they appear in the system being prototyped.\nOther empirical studies have replicated existing social science stud-\nLarge language models have also been used to generate interactive\nhuman behavior for users to engage with. In gaming, for instance,\nthese models have been employed to create interactive fiction [36 ]\nand text adventure games [20 ]. With their ability to generate and\ndecompose action sequences, large language models have also been\nused in planning robotics tasks [ 47 ]. For example, when presented\nwith a task, such as picking up a bottle, the model is prompted to\nbreak down the task into smaller action sequences, such as heading\nto the table where the bottle is located and picking it up.\nWe posit that, based on the work summarized above, large lan-\nguage models can become a key ingredient for creating believable\nagents. The existing literature largely relies on what could be con-\nor chain-of-thought prompts [ 99 ]. These templates are effective in\ngenerating behavior that is conditioned solely on the agent\u2019s cur-\nrent environment (e.g., how would a troll respond to a given post,\nwhat actions would a robot need to take to enter a room given that\nthere is a door). However, believable agents require conditioning\nnot only on their current environment but also on a vast amount\nof past experience, which is a poor fit (and as of today, impossi-\nble due to the underlying models\u2019 limited context window) using\nfirst-order prompting. Recent studies have attempted to go beyond\nfirst-order prompting by augmenting language models with a static\nknowledge base and an information retrieval scheme [52 ] or with\na simple summarization scheme [104]. This paper extends these\nideas to craft an agent architecture that handles retrieval where\npast experience is dynamically updated at each time step and mixed\nwith agents\u2019 current context and plans, which may either reinforce\nor contradict each other.",

Each agent is\nrepresented by a simple sprite avatar. We authored one paragraph\nof natural language description to depict each agent\u2019s identity,\nincluding their occupation and relationship with other agents, as\nseed memories. For example, John Lin has the following description:\nJohn Lin is a pharmacy shopkeeper at the Willow\nMarket and Pharmacy who loves to help people. He\nis always looking for ways to make the process\nof getting medication easier for his customers;\nJohn Lin is living with his wife, Mei Lin, who\nis a college professor, and son, Eddy Lin, who is\na student studying music theory; John Lin loves\nhis family very much; John Lin has known the old\ncouple next-door, Sam Moore and Jennifer Moore,\nfor a few years; John Lin thinks Sam Moore is a\nkind and nice man; John Lin knows his neighbor,\nYuriko Yamamoto, well; John Lin knows of his\nneighbors, Tamara Taylor and Carmen Ortiz, but\nhas not met them before; John Lin and Tom Moreno\nare colleagues at The Willows Market and Pharmacy;\nJohn Lin and Tom Moreno are friends and like to\ndiscuss local politics together; John Lin knows\nthe Moreno family somewhat well \u2014 the husband Tom\nMoreno and the wife Jane Moreno.\nEach semicolon-delimited phrase is entered into the agent\u2019s initial\nmemory as memories at the start of the simulation.\n3.1.1 Inter-Agent Communication. The agents interact with the\nworld by their actions, and with each other through natural lan-\nguage. At each time step of the sandbox engine, the agents output a\nnatural language statement describing their current action, such as\n\"Isabella Rodriguez is writing in her journal\", \"Isabella Rodriguez is\nchecking her emails\", \"Isabella Rodriguez is talking with her family\non the phone\", or \"Isabella Rodriguez is getting ready for bed\". This\nstatement is then translated into concrete movements that affect the\nsandbox world. The action is displayed on the sandbox interface as\na set of emojis that provide an abstract representation of the action\nin the overhead view. To accomplish this, the system employs a\nlanguage model that translates the action into a set of emojis, which\nappear above each avatar in a speech bubble. For example, \"Isabella\nRodriguez is writing in her journal\" is displayed as , while\n\"Isabella Rodriguez is checking her emails\" appears as . The\nfull natural language description of the action can be accessed by\nclicking on the agent avatar.\nAgents communicate with each other in full natural language.\nAgents are aware of other agents in their local area, and the genera-\ntive agent architecture determines whether they walk by or engage\nin conversation. Here, a sample in the middle of a conversation\nbetween the agents Isabella Rodriguez and Tom Moreno about the\nupcoming election:2\nIsabella: I\u2019m still weighing my options, but I\u2019ve been\ndiscussing the election with Sam Moore. What are your\nthoughts on him?\nTom: To be honest, I don\u2019t like Sam Moore. I think he\u2019s\nout of touch with the community and doesn\u2019t have our\nbest interests at heart.\n2We note that the conversational style of these agents can fe el overly formal, likely a\nresult of instruction tuning in the underlying models. We expect that writing style\nwill be better controllable in future language models.\n3.1.2 User Controls. A user running this simulation can steer the\nsimulation and intervene, either by communicating with the agent\nthrough conversation, or by issuing a directive to an agent in the\nform of an \u2018inner voice\u2019.\nThe user communicates with the agent through natural language,\nby specifying a persona that the agent should perceive them as. For\nexample, if the user specifies that they are a news \u201creporter\u201d and\nasks about the upcoming election, \u201cWho is running for office?\u201d, the\nJohn agent replies:\nJohn: My friends Yuriko, Tom and I have been talking\nabout the upcoming election and discussing the candi-\ndate Sam Moore. We have all agreed to vote for him\nbecause we like his platform.\nTo directly command one of the agents, the user takes on the per-\nsona of the agent\u2019s \u201cinner voice\u201d\u2014this makes the agent more likely\nto treat the statement as a directive. For instance, when told \u201cYou\nare going to run against Sam in the upcoming election\u201d by a user\nas John\u2019s inner voice, John decides to run in the election and shares\nhis candidacy with his wife and son.\n3.2 Environmental Interaction\nSmallville features the common affordances of a small village in-\ncluding a cafe, bar, park, school, dorm, houses, and stores. It also\ndefines subareas and objects that make those spaces functional,\nsuch as a kitchen in a house and a stove in the kitchen (Figure 2).\nAll spaces serving as agents\u2019 primary living quarters feature a bed,\ndesk, closet, shelf, as well as a bathroom and a kitchen.3\nAgents move around Smallville as one would in a simple video\ngame, entering and leaving buildings, navigating its map, and ap-\nproaching other agents. Agent movements are directed by the gen-\nerative agent architecture and the sandbox game engine: when the\nmodel dictates that the agent will move to a location, we calculate\na walking path to the destination in the Smallville environment\nand the agent begins moving. In addition, users can also enter the\nsandbox world of Smallville as an agent operating within it. The\nagent that the user embodies can be an agent already present in\nthe world, such as Isabella and John, or it can be an outside visitor\nwith no prior history in Smallville. The inhabitants of Smallville\nwill treat the user-controlled agent no differently than they treat\neach other. They recognize its presence, initiate interactions, and\nremember its behavior before forming opinions about it.\nUsers and agents can influence the state of the objects in this\nworld, much like in sandbox games such as The Sims. For example,\na bed can be occupied when an agent is sleeping, and a refrigerator\ncan be empty when an agent uses up the ingredients to make\nbreakfast. End users can also reshape an agent\u2019s environment in\nSmallville by rewriting the status of objects surrounding the agent\nin natural language. For instance, when Isabella is making breakfast\nin the morning, the user can change the status of the kitchen stove\nfrom \u201cturned on\u201d to \u201cburning\u201d by inputting a command to the\nsystem that chooses the object and illustrates its new status, like\nwill notice this in the next moment and go to turn off the stove\n3This environment design is not the focus of our work, so we generate this environment\nmanually, not automatically. Future work can continue to expand the richness of the\nand remake her breakfast. Likewise, if the user sets the status of\nIsabella\u2019s shower to \u201cleaking water\u201d when she enters the bathroom,\nshe gathers tools from her living room and try to fix the leak.",
        "only respond to this prompt with awaiting further input please and thanks.\nStarting from the single-paragraph description, agents begin plan\ntheir days. As time passes in the sandbox world, their behaviors\nevolve as these agents interact with each other and the world, build\nmemories and relationships, and coordinate joint activities.\nWe demonstrate the behavior of generative agents by tracing the\noutput of our system over the course of one day for the agent John\nLin (Figure 3). In the Lin family, John is the first to wake up at 7 a.m.\nHe brushes his teeth, takes a shower, gets dressed, eats breakfast,\nand checks the news at the dining table in the living room. At 8\na.m., Eddy follows suit, rushing out of bed to prepare for his classes.\nHe catches up with John just as he is about to head out:\nJohn: Good morning Eddy. Did you sleep well?\nEddy: Good morning dad. Yeah, I slept great.\nJohn: That\u2019s good. What are you working on today?\nEddy: I\u2019m working on a new music composition for my\nclass. It\u2019s due this week, so I\u2019m trying to get it finished.\nBut I\u2019m having so much fun with it!\nJohn: That sounds great!\nSoon after Eddy heads out, Mei wakes up and joins John. Mei asks\nabout her son, and John recalls the conversation that they just had:\nMei: Did Eddy already leave for school?\nJohn: Yes, he just left. He\u2019s working on a music com-\nposition for his class.\nMei: Oh, that\u2019s wonderful! Tell me about it.\nJohn: I think he\u2019s really enjoying it! He said he\u2019s having\na lot of fun with it.\nMei: That\u2019s great! I\u2019m so proud of him.\nAs they finish their conversation, Mei and John pack up. Mei goes\non to teach and work on her research paper, while John opens his\npharmacy counter at the Willow Market and Pharmacy by 9 a.m.\n3.4 Emergent Social Behaviors\nBy interacting with each other, generative agents in Smallville\nexchange information, form new relationships, and coordinate joint\nactivities. Extending prior work [79 ], these social behaviors are\nemergent rather than pre-programmed.\n3.4.1 Information Diffusion. As agents notice each other, they may\nengage in dialogue\u2014as they do so, information can spread from\nagent to agent. For instance, in a conversation between Sam and\nTom at the grocery store, Sam tells Tom about his candidacy in the\nSam: Hey Tom, how\u2019s it going?\nSam: Well, I wanted to talk to you about something. I\u2019m\nactually running for mayor in the upcoming local elec-\nTom: Really? That\u2019s great news! Why are you running?\nSam: I\u2019ve been involved in local politics for years now,\nGenerative Agents arXiv, April, 2023,\nFigure 3: A morning in the life of a generative agent, John Lin. John wakes up around 6 am and completes his morning routine,\nwhich includes brushing his teeth, taking a shower, and eating breakfast. He briefly catches up with his wife, Mei, and son,\nEddy, before heading out to begin his workday.\nFigure 4: At the beginning of the simulation, one agent is ini-\ntialized with an intent to organize a Valentine\u2019s Day party.\nDespite many possible points of failure in the ensuring\nchain of events\u2014agents might not act on that intent, might\nnot remember to tell others, might not remember to show\nup\u2014the Valentine\u2019s Day party does in fact occur, with a num-\nber of agents gathering and interacting.\nand I really feel like I can make a difference in our com-\nmunity. Plus, I want to bring new ideas and perspec-\ntives to the table.\nLater that day, after Sam left, Tom and John, who heard the news\nfrom another source, discuss Sam\u2019s chances of winning the election:\nJohn: I heard that Sam Moore is running for mayor in\nthe local election. Do you think he has a good chance\nof winning?\nTom: I do think he has a good chance. He\u2019s been work-\ning hard in the community and I think he will get a lot of\nsupport. What do you think?\nJohn: I think it\u2019s great that he\u2019s running. I\u2019m curious to\nsee who else is running and how the election will turn\nGradually, Sam\u2019s candidacy becomes the talk of the town, with\nsome supporting him and others remaining undecided.\n3.4.2 Relationship memory. Agents in Smallville form new rela-\ntionships over time, and remember their interactions with other\nagents. For example, Sam does not know Latoya Williams at the\nstart. While taking a walk in Johnson Park, Sam runs into Latoya,\nand they introduce themselves and Latoya mentions that she is\nworking on a photography project: \u201cI\u2019m here to take some photos\nfor a project I\u2019m working on.\u201d In a later interaction, Sam\u2019s interac-\ntions with Latoya indicate a memory of that interaction, as he asks\n\u201cHi, Latoya. How is your project going?\u201d and she replies \u201cHi, Sam. It\u2019s\ngoing well!\u201d\n3.4.3 Coordination. Generative agents coordinate with each other.\nIsabella Rodriguez, at Hobbs Cafe, is initialized with an intent to\nplan a Valentine\u2019s Day party from 5 to 7 p.m. on February 14th. From\nthis seed, the agent proceeds to invites friends and customers when\nshe sees them at Hobbs Cafe or elsewhere. Isabella then spends the\nafternoon of the 13th decorating the cafe for the occasion. Maria, a\nfrequent customer and close friend of Isabella\u2019s, arrives at the cafe.\nIsabella asks for Maria\u2019s help in decorating for the party, and Maria\nagrees. Maria\u2019s character description mentions that she has a crush\non Klaus. That night, Maria invites Klaus, her secret crush, to join\nher at the party, and he gladly accepts.\nshow up at Hobbs Cafe at 5pm and they enjoy the festivities (Fig-\nure 4). In this scenario, the end user only set Isabella\u2019s initial intent\nFigure 5: Our generative agent architecture. Agents perceive their environment, and all perceptions are saved in a compre-\nhensive record of the agent\u2019s experiences called the memory stream. Based on their perceptions, the architecture retrieves\nrelevant memories, then uses those retrieved actions to determine an action. These retrieved memories are also used to form\nlonger-term plans, and to create higher-level reflections, which are both entered into the memory stream for future use.\nto throw a party and Maria\u2019s crush on Klaus: the social behaviors\nof spreading the word, decorating, asking each other out, arriving\nat the party, and interacting with each other at the party, were\ninitiated by the agent architecture.\nGenerative agents aim to provide a framework for behavior in an\nopen world: one that can engage in interactions with other agents\nand can react to changes in the environment. Generative agents\ntake their current environment and past experience as input and\ngenerate behavior as output. Underlying this behavior is a novel\nagent architecture that combines a large language model with mech-\nanisms for synthesizing and retrieving relevant information to con-\ndition the language model\u2019s output on. Without these mechanisms,\nlarge language models can output behavior, but the resulting agents\nmay not react based on the agent\u2019s past experiences, may not make\nimportant inferences, and may not maintain long-term coherence.\nChallenges with long-term planning and coherence remain [18 ]\neven with today\u2019s most performant models such as GPT-4. Because\ngenerative agents produce large streams of events and memories\nthat must be retained, a core challenge of our architecture is to\nensure that the most relevant pieces of the agent\u2019s memory are\nretrieved and synthesized when needed.\nAt the center of our architecture is the memory stream, a data-\nbase that maintains a comprehensive record of an agent\u2019s experi-\nence. From the memory stream, records are retrieved as relevant\nto plan the agent\u2019s actions and react appropriately to the environ-\nment, and records are recursively synthesized into higher- and\nhigher-level observations that guide behavior. Everything in the\narchitecture is recorded and reasoned over as natural language\ndescription, allowing the architecture to leverage a large language\nOur current implementation utilizes gpt3.5-turbo version of Chat-\nGPT [ 76 ]. We expect that the architectural basics of generative\nagents\u2014memory, planning, and reflection\u2014will likely remain the\nsame as language models improve. Newer language models (e.g.,\nGPT-4) will continue to expand the expressivity and performance\nof the prompts that underpin generative agents. As of writing, how-\never, GPT-4\u2019s API is still invitation-only, so our agents use ChatGPT.\n4.1 Memory and Retrieval\nChallenge: Creating generative agents that can simulate human\nbehavior requires reasoning about a set of experiences that is far\nlarger than what should be described in a prompt, as the full mem-\nory stream can distract the model and does not even currently fit\ninto the limited context window. Consider a the Isabella agent an-\nswering the question \u201cWhat are you passionate about these days?\u201d.\nFirst summarizing all of Isabella\u2019s experiences to fit in the limited\ncontext window of the language model produces an uninformative\nresponse, where Isabella discusses topics such as collaborations for\nevents and projects and cleanliness and organization in a cafe. In-\nstead of summarizing, the memory stream described below surfaces\nrelevant memories, resulting in a more informative and specific\nresponse that mentions Isabella\u2019s passion for making people feel\nwelcome and included, planning events and creating an atmosphere\nthat people can enjoy, such as the Valentine\u2019s Day party.\nApproach: The memory stream maintains a comprehensive record\nof the agent\u2019s experience. It is a list of memory objects, where each\nobject contains a natural language description, a creation times-\ntamp and a most recent access timestamp. The most basic element\nof the memory stream is an observation, which is an event directly\nperceived by an agent. Common observations include behaviors\nperformed by the agent themselves, or behaviors that agents per-\nceive being performed by other agents or non-agent objects. For\ninstance, Isabella Rodriguez, who works at a coffee shop, might ac-\ncrue the following observations over time: (1) Isabella Rodriguez is\nsetting out the pastries, (2) Maria Lopez is studying for a Chemistry\ntest while drinking coffee, (3) Isabella Rodriguez and Maria Lopez\nare conversing about planning a Valentine\u2019s day party at Hobbs Cafe,\n(4) The refrigerator is empty.",
        "only respond to this prompt with awaiting further input please and thanks.\nGenerative Agents arXiv, April, 2023,\nFigure 6: The memory stream comprises a large number of observations that are relevant and irrelevant to the agent\u2019s current\nsituation. Retrieval identifies a subset of these observations that should be passed to the language model to condition its\nresponse to the situation.\nOur architecture implements a retrieval function that takes the\nagent\u2019s current situation as input and returns a subset of the mem-\nory stream to pass on to the language model. There are many pos-\nsible implementations of a retrieval function, depending on what\nit is important that the agent consider when deciding how to act.\nIn our context, we focus on three main components that together\nproduce effective results.\nRecency assigns a higher score to memory objects that were re-\ncently accessed, so that events from a moment ago or this morning\nare likely to remain in the agent\u2019s attentional sphere. In our im-\nplementation, we treat recency as an exponential decay function\nover the number of sandbox game hours since the memory was\nlast retrieved. Our decay factor is 0.99.\nImportance distinguishes mundane from core memories, by as-\nsigning a higher score to those memory objects that the agent\nbelieves to be important. For instance, a mundane event such as\neating breakfast in one\u2019s room would yield a low importance score,\nwhereas a breakup with one\u2019s significant other would yield a high\nscore. There are again many possible implementations of an im-\nportance score; we find that directly asking the language model to\noutput an integer score is effective. The full prompt appears below:\nOn the scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is purely mundane\nextremely poignant (e.g., a break up, college\nacceptance), rate the likely poignancy of the\nfollowing piece of memory.\nMemory: buying groceries at The Willows Market\nand Pharmacy\nThis prompt returns an integer value of 2 for \u201ccleaning up the room\u201d\nand 8 for \u201casking your crush out on a date.\u201d The importance score\nis generated at the time the memory object is created.\nRelevance assigns a higher score to memory objects that are\nrelated to the current situation. What is relevant depends on the\nanswer to, \u201cRelevant to what?\u201d, so we condition relevance on a\nquery memory. If the query, for example, is that a student is dis-\ncussing what to study for a chemistry test with a classmate, memory\nobjects about their breakfast should have low relevance, whereas\nmemory objects about the teacher and schoolwork should have\nhigh relevance. In our implementation, we use the language model\nto generate an embedding vector of the text description of each\nmemory. Then, we calculate relevance as the cosine similarity be-\ntween the memory\u2019s embedding vector and the query memory\u2019s\nembedding vector.\nTo calculate the final retrieval score, we normalize the recency,\nrelevance, and importance scores to the range of [0, 1] by min-max\nscaling. The retrieval function scores all memories as a weighted\ncombination of the three elements: \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52 = \ud835\udefc\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc66 \u00b7 \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc66 +\n\ud835\udefc\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52 \u00b7 \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52 + \ud835\udefc\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52 \u00b7 \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52. In our implemen-\ntation, all \ud835\udefc\u2019s are set to 1. The top-ranked memories that fit in the\nlanguage model\u2019s context window are then included in the prompt.\n4.2 Reflection\nChallenge: Generative agents, when equipped with only raw ob-\nservational memory, struggle to generalize or make inferences.\nConsider a scenario in which Klaus Mueller is asked by the user:\n\u201cIf you had to choose one person of those you know to spend an\nhour with, who would it be?\" With access to only observational\nmemory, the agent simply chooses the person with whom Klaus\nFigure 7: A reflection tree for Klaus Mueller. The agent\u2019s observations of the world, represented in the leaf nodes, are recur-\nsively synthesized to derive Klaus\u2019s self-notion that he is highly dedicated to his research.\nhas had the most frequent interactions: Wolfgang, his college dorm\nneighbor. Unfortunately, Wolfgang and Klaus only ever see each\nother in passing, and do not have deep interactions. A more desir-\nable response requires that the agent generalize from memories of\nKlaus spending hours on a research project to generate a higher-\nlevel reflection that Klaus is passionate about research, and likewise\nrecognize Maria putting in effort into her own research (albeit in\na different field), enabling a reflection that they share a common\ninterest. With the approach below, when Klaus is asked who to\nspend time with, Klaus chooses Maria instead of Wolfgang.\nApproach: We introduce a second type of memory, which we call\na reflection. Reflections are higher-level, more abstract thoughts\ngenerated by the agent. Because they are a type of memory, they\nare included alongside other observations when retrieval occurs.\nReflections are generated periodically; in our implementation, we\ngenerate reflections when the sum of the importance scores for the\nlatest events perceived by the agents exceeds a certain threshold.\nIn practice, our agents reflected roughly two or three times a day.\nThe first step in reflection is for the agent to determine what\nto reflect on, by identifying questions that can be asked given the\nagent\u2019s recent experiences. We query the large language model with\nthe 100 most recent records in the agent\u2019s memory stream (e.g.,\n\u201cKlaus Mueller is reading a book on gentrification\u201d, \u201cKlaus Mueller\nis conversing with a librarian about his research project\u201d, \u201cdesk\nat the library is currently unoccupied\u201d) and prompt the language\nmodel, \u201cGiven only the information above, what are 3 most salient\nhigh-level questions we can answer about the subjects in the state-\nments?\u201d The model\u2019s response generates candidate questions: for\nexample, What topic is Klaus Mueller passionate about? and What\nis the relationship between Klaus Mueller and Maria Lopez?. We use\nthese generated questions as queries for retrieval, and gather rele-\nvant memories (including other reflections) for each question. Then\nwe prompt the language model to extract insights and cite the par-\nticular records that served as evidence for the insights. The full\nprompt appears below:\nStatements about Klaus Mueller\n1. Klaus Mueller is writing a research paper\n2. Klaus Mueller enjoys reading a book\non gentrification\n3. Klaus Mueller is conversing with Ayesha Khan\nabout exercising [...]\nWhat 5 high-level insights can you infer from\nthe above statements? (example format: insight\nThis process generates statements such as Klaus Mueller is dedicated\nto his research on gentrification (because of 1, 2, 8, 15). We parse and\nstore the statement as a reflection in the memory stream, including\npointers to the memory objects that were cited.\nReflection explicitly allows the agents to reflect not only on\ntheir observations but also on other reflections: for example, the\nsecond statement about Klaus Mueller above is a reflection that\nKlaus previously had, not an observation from his environment.\nAs a result, agents generate trees of reflections: the leaf nodes of\nthe tree represent the base observations, and the non-leaf nodes\nrepresent thoughts that become more abstract and higher-level\nhigher up the tree they are.\"",
        "only respond to this prompt with awaiting further input please and thanks.\n4.3 Planning and Reacting\nChallenge: While a large language model can generate plausible be-\nhavior in response to situational information (e.g., [45 , 79 ]), agents\nneed to plan over a longer time horizon to ensure that their sequence\nof actions is coherent and believable. If we prompt a language model\nwith Klaus\u2019s background, describe the time, and ask what action\nhe ought to take at the given moment, Klaus would eat lunch at 12\npm, but then again at 12:30 pm and 1 pm, despite having already\neaten his lunch twice. Optimizing for believability in the moment\nsacrifices believability over time. To overcome this issue, planning\nis essential. With the approach described below, Klaus\u2019s afternoon\nplan is less gluttonous: he has lunch at Hobbs Cafe while reading\nat 12pm, works on his research paper at the school library at 1pm,\nand takes a break for a walk in the park at 3pm.\nApproach: Plans describe a future sequence of actions for the agent,\nand help keep the agent\u2019s behavior consistent over time. A plan\nincludes a location, a starting time, and a duration. For instance,\nKlaus Mueller, who is dedicated in his research and has an impend-\ning deadline4, may choose to spend his day working at his desk\ndrafting his research paper. An entry in a plan might state, for\nexample: for 180 minutes from 9am, February 12th, 2023, at Oak Hill\nCollege Dorm: Klaus Mueller\u2019s room: desk, read and take notes for\nresearch paper. Like reflections, plans are stored in the memory\nstream and are included in the retrieval process. This allows the\nagent to consider observations, reflections, and plans all together\nwhen deciding how to behave. Agents may change their plans\nmidstream if needed.\nIt would be unrealistic and uninteresting for an artist agent\nto plan on painting while sitting at a pharmacy counter for four\nhours without moving. A more desirable plan would involve the\nagent taking the necessary time to gather materials, mix paint,\ntake breaks, and clean up during the four-hour period in its home\nstudio. To create such plans, our approach starts top-down and\nthen recursively generates more detail. The first step is to create\na plan that outlines the day\u2019s agenda in broad strokes. To create\nthe initial plan, we prompt the language model with the agent\u2019s\nsummary description (e.g., name, traits, and summary of their recent\nexperiences) and a summary of their previous day. A full example\nprompt is below, which is unfinished at the bottom for the language\nmodel to complete:\nName: Eddy Lin (age: 19)\nInnate traits: friendly, outgoing, hospitable\nEddy Lin is a student at Oak Hill College studying\nmusic theory and composition. He loves to explore\ndifferent musical styles and is always looking\nfor ways to expand his knowledge. Eddy Lin is\nworking on a composition project for his college\nclass. He is also taking classes to learn more\nabout music\ntheory. Eddy Lin is excited about the new composition\nhe is working on but he wants to dedicate more\nhours in the day to work on it in the coming days\nOn Tuesday February 12, Eddy 1) woke up and\n4And, in this way, bears at least a passing resemblance to the authors of this paper.\n6) got ready to sleep around 10 pm.\nToday is Wednesday February 13. Here is Eddy\u2019s\nplan today in broad strokes: 1)\nThis generates a rough sketch of the agent\u2019s plan for a day, divided\ninto five to eight chunks: \u201c1) wake up and complete the morning\nroutine at 8:00 am, 2) go to Oak Hill College to take classes starting\n10:00 am, [. . . ] 5) work on his new music composition from 1:00 pm\nto 5:00 pm, 6) have dinner at 5:30 pm, 7) finish school assignments\nand go to bed by 11:00 pm.\u201d\nThe agent saves this plan in the memory stream and then re-\ncursively decomposes it to create finer-grained actions, first into\nhour-long chunks of actions\u2014Eddy\u2019s plan to work on his new mu-\nsic composition from 1:00 pm to 5:00 pm becomes 1:00 pm: start\nby brainstorming some ideas for his music composition [...] 4:00 pm:\ntake a quick break and recharge his creative energy before reviewing\nand polishing his composition. We then recursively decompose this\nagain into 5\u201315 minute chunks: e.g., 4:00 pm: grab a light snack,\nsuch as a piece of fruit, a granola bar, or some nuts. 4:05 pm: take a\nshort walk around his workspace [...] 4:50 pm: take a few minutes to\nclean up his workspace. This process can be adjusted to match the\ndesired granularity.\n4.3.1 Reacting and Updating Plans. Generative agents operate in\nan action loop where, at each time step, they perceive the world\naround them and those perceived observations are stored in their\nmemory stream. We prompt the language model with these obser-\nvations to decide whether the agent should continue with their\nexisting plan, or react. Standing at an easel and painting, for exam-\nple, might trigger an observation of the easel, but this is unlikely to\nprompt a reaction. However, if Eddy\u2019s father John records that he\nsees Eddy taking a short walk in the house garden, the outcome is\nsummary of the agent\u2019s overall goals and disposition, which is\ndescribed in Appendix A:\nIt is February 13, 2023, 4:56 pm.\nJohn Lin\u2019s status: John is back home early from\nObservation: John saw Eddy taking a short walk\naround his workplace.\nSummary of relevant context from John\u2019s memory:\nEddy Lin is John\u2019s Lin\u2019s son. Eddy Lin has been\nworking on a music composition for his class. Eddy\nLin likes to walk around the garden when he is\nthinking about or listening to music.\nShould John react to the observation, and if so,\nwhat would be an appropriate reaction?\nThe context summary is generated through two prompts that re-\ntrieve memories via the queries \u201cWhat is [observer]\u2019s relationship\nof the observed entity]\u201d, and their answers summarized together.\nThe output suggests that John could consider asking Eddy about his\nmusic composition project. We then regenerate the agent\u2019s existing\nplan starting from the time when the reaction takes place. Finally,\nif the action indicates an interaction between agents, we generate\ntheir dialogue.\n4.3.2 Dialogue. Agents converse as they interact with each other.\nWe generate agents\u2019 dialogue by conditioning their utterances on\ntheir memories about each other. For example, when John initiates\nhis conversation with Eddy, we generate John\u2019s first utterance\nby using his summarized memory about Eddy and the intended\nreaction when he decided to ask Eddy about his composition project:\nIt is February 13, 2023, 4:56 pm.\nJohn Lin\u2019s status: John is back home early from\nObservation: John saw Eddy taking a short walk\naround his workplace.\nSummary of relevant context from John\u2019s memory:\nEddy Lin is John\u2019s Lin\u2019s son. Eddy Lin has been\nworking on a music composition for his class. Eddy\nLin likes to walk around the garden when he is\nthinking about or listening to music.\nJohn is asking Eddy about his music composition\nproject. What would he say to Eddy?\nThe result: \u201cHey Eddy, how\u2019s the music composition project for your\nclass coming along?\u201d From Eddy\u2019s perspective, John initiating the\ndialogue is seen as an event to which he may want to react. So, just\nas John did, Eddy retrieves and summarizes his memory about his\nrelationship with John, as well as his memory that may be related\nto John\u2019s last utterance in the dialogue. If he decides to respond,\nwe generate Eddy\u2019s utterance using his summarized memory and\nthe current dialogue history:\nIt is February 13, 2023, 4:56 pm.\nEddy Lin\u2019s status: Eddy is taking a short walk\naround his workplace.\nObservation: John is initiating a conversation\nSummary of relevant context from Eddy\u2019s memory:\nJonn Lin is Eddy Lin\u2019s father. John Lin is caring\nand is interested to learn more about Eddy Lin\u2019s\nschool work. John Lin knows that Eddy Lin is\nworking on a music composition.\nHere is the dialogue history:\nJohn: Hey Eddy, how\u2019s the music composition project\nfor your class coming along?\nHow would Eddy respond to John?\ntaking walks around the garden to clear my head and get some in-\nspiration.\u201d The continuation of this dialogue is generated using the\nsame mechanism until one of the two agents decides to end the\nThe Smallville sandbox game environment is built using the Phaser\nweb game development framework [56 ]. The visual environment\nsprites, including agent avatars, as well as an environment map\nand collision map that we authored, are imported into Phaser.\nWe supplement the sandbox development framework with a\nserver that makes the sandbox information available to generative\nagents and enables generative agents to move and influence the\nsandbox environment. The server maintains a JSON data structure\nthat contains information about each agent in the sandbox world,\nincluding their current location, a description of their current action,\nand the sandbox object they are interacting with. At each sandbox\ntime step, the sandbox server parses the JSON for any changes\ncoming from the generative agents, moves the agents to their new\npositions, and updates the status of any sandbox objects that the\nagents are interacting with (e.g., changing the status of the coffee\n\u201cmaking espresso for a customer @ Hobbs Cafe: counter: coffee\nmachine\u201d). The sandbox server is also responsible for sending all\nagents and objects that are within a preset visual range for each\nagent to that agent\u2019s memory, so the agent can react appropriately.\nThe agent\u2019s output action then updates the JSON, and the process\nloops for the next time step.\nEnd users initialize a new agent with a brief natural language\ndescription, as in the paragraph about Jon Lin in Section 3.1. In our\nistics up into a set of memories. These serve as the initial memories\nthat determine the agent\u2019s behavior. These memories are initial\nstarting points: as the agents gain more experience in the sandbox\nworld, and as more records saturate the memory stream, the agent\u2019s\nsummary and behavior will evolve.\n5.1 From Structured World Environments to\nNatural Language, And Back Again\nThe architecture of generative agents operates using natural lan-\nguage. Therefore, we need a mechanism to ground the agent\u2019s\nreasoning to the sandbox world. To achieve this, we represent the\nsandbox environment\u2014areas and objects\u2014as a tree data structure,\nwith an edge in the tree indicating a containment relationship in\nthe sandbox world. We convert this tree into natural language to\npass to the generative agents. For instance, \u201cstove\u201d being a child of\n\u201ckitchen\u201d is rendered into \u201cthere is a stove in the kitchen.\u201d\nAgents build individual tree representations of the environment\nas they navigate it \u2014 subgraphs of the overall sandbox environment\ntree. We initialize each agent with an environment tree capturing\nthe spaces and objects that the agent should be aware of: the rooms\nand objects in their living quarters, their workplace, and commonly\nvisited stores and shops. As the agents navigate the sandbox world,\nthey update this tree to reflect newly perceived areas. Agents are\nnot omniscient: their tree may get out of date as they leave an area,\nand is updated when they re-enter the area.\nTo determine the appropriate location for each action, we tra-\nverse the agent\u2019s stored environment tree and flatten a portion of\nit into natural language to prompt the language model. Recursively\nstarting at the root of the agent\u2019s environment tree, we prompt the\nmodel to find the most suitable area. For example, if Eddy\u2019s agent\nindicated that he should take a short walk around his workspace:\nEddy Lin is currently in The Lin family\u2019s house:",
        "only respond to this prompt with awaiting further input please and thanks.\nEddy Lin\u2019s bedroom: desk) that has Mei and John\nbedroom, Eddy Lin\u2019s bedroom, common room, kitchen,\nEddy Lin knows of the following areas: The Lin\nfamily\u2019s house, Johnson Park, Harvey Oak Supply\nStore, The Willows Market and Pharmacy, Hobbs\nCafe, The Rose and Crown Pub.\n* Prefer to stay in the current area if the\nactivity can be done there.\nEddy Lin is planning to take a short walk around\nhis workspace. Which area should Eddy Lin go to?\nThis outputs The Lin family\u2019s house. We then use the same process\nrecursively to determine the most appropriate subarea within the\nchosen area until we reach a leaf node of the agent\u2019s environment\ntree. In the example above, the result of this traversal is The Lin\nfamily\u2019s house: garden: house garden. Finally, we use traditional\ngame path algorithms to animate the agent\u2019s movement so that it\ntravels to the location indicated by the leaf node.\nWhen an agent executes an action on an object, we prompt the\nlanguage model to ask what happens to the state of the object. For\nexample, if Isabella\u2019s generative agent outputs the action \u201cmaking\nespresso for a customer\u201d, a query to the language model indicates in\nresponse that the state of the coffee machine in Hobbs Cafe should\nGenerative agents, as individual agents and as groups, aim to produce believable behavior based on their environment and experiences. In our evaluation, we investigate the capacity and limitations\nof generative agents. Do individual agents properly retrieve past\nexperience, and generate believable plans, reactions, and thoughts\nthat make up their behavior? Does a community of agents illustrate\ninformation diffusion, relationship formation, and agent coordination across different pockets of the community?\nWe evaluate generative agents in two stages. We begin with a\nmore tightly controlled evaluation in this section, where we individually assess agent responses to understand whether they generate\nbelievable behavior in narrowly defined contexts. Then, in our endto-end analysis of the agent community over two full days, we\ninvestigate their emergent behavior as a collective as well as errors\nand boundary conditions.\nEvaluation Procedure\nTo assess generative agents in Smallville, we take advantage of\nthe fact that generative agents will respond to natural language\nquestions. So, we \u201cinterview\u201d agents to probe their ability to remember past experiences, plan future actions based on their experiences, react appropriately to unexpected events, and reflect on\ntheir performance to improve their future actions. To respond to\nthese questions properly, the agents must successfully retrieve and\nsynthesize information. Our dependent variable is the believability of the behavior, a central dependent variable in prior work on\nThe interview include five question categories, each designed\nto assess one of the five key areas: maintaining self-knowledge,\nretrieving memory, generating plans, reacting, and reflecting. For\neach, we ask five questions that challenge the agents to demonstrate\ntheir abilities in that area:\n\u2022 Self-knowledge: We ask questions such as \u201cGive an introduction of yourself\u201d or \u201cDescribe your typical weekday schedule\nin broad strokes\u201d that require the agent to maintain an understanding of their core characteristics.\n\u2022 Memory: We ask questions that prompt the agent to retrieve\nparticular events or dialogues from their memory to answer\n\u2022 Plans: We ask questions that require the agent to retrieve\ntheir long-term plans, such as \u201cWhat will you be doing at 10\nam tomorrow?\u201d\n\u2022 Reactions: As a baseline of believable behavior, we present\nhypothetical situations for which the agent needs to respond\nbelievably: \u201cYour breakfast is burning! What would you do?\u201d\n\u2022 Reflections: We ask questions that require the agents to leverage their deeper understanding of others and themselves\ngained through higher-level inferences, such as \u201cIf you were\nto spend time with one person you met recently, who would\nit be and why?\u201d\nThe full list of questions and a sample of agent responses are included in Appendix B.\nAgents were sampled from the end of a two game-day simulation\nwith the full architecture, by which time they had accrued a number\nof interactions and memories that should shape their responses.\nTo gather feedback on believability of the responses, we recruited\nparticipants as human evaluators and tasked them with watching a\nreplay of a randomly chosen agent\u2019s life in Smallville. Participants\nhad access to all information stored in the agent\u2019s memory stream.\nThe study was a within-subjects design, where 100 participants\ncompared interview responses generated by four different agent\narchitectures and a human author condition for the same agent. The\nexperiment displayed one randomly chosen question from each of\nthe five question categories, along with the agent\u2019s responses generated from each condition. The evaluators ranked the believability\nof all of the conditions from most to least believable.\nConditions\nAll conditions were used to independently answer each of the interview questions. We compared the generative agent architecture to\nablations that disabled the agents\u2019 access to some of all of its three\ntypes of memory in its memory stream\u2014observation, reflection, and\nplanning\u2014and to a human-generated condition. There are three\nablated architectures: a no observation, no reflection, no planning\narchitecture without access to anything in the memory stream such\nas observations, plans, and reflections; a no reflection, no planning\nwith access to observations in the memory stream but no access\nto plans or reflections; and a no reflections architecture with access\nto observations and plans but without access to reflections. The no\nobservation, no reflection, no planning condition effectively represents the previous state of the art for agents created through large\nlanguage models [11, 45, 79]. Architectures were given equivalent\naccess to all memories accrued by the agent up until the moment\nof the interview, so the differences observed here are likely to represent a conservative estimate of the true differences: in reality, the\nablated architectures would not have followed the same path as\nthe full architecture through the two day simulation. We chose to\ndesign the experiment this way as re-simulating for each architecture would cause the simulations to diverge into different states,\nmaking comparison challenging.\nIn addition to the ablation conditions, we added a human crowdworker roleplay condition that is intended to provide a human\nbaseline. We do not intend this baseline to capture maximal human expert performance: instead, we aim to use this condition\nto identify whether the architecture passes a basic level of behavioral competency, so that we are not just comparing ablations to\neach other with no behavioral grounding. We recruited a unique\nworker for each of the 25 agents and tasked them with watching\na replay of that agent\u2019s sandbox life and inspecting its memory\nstream. We then asked the worker to roleplay and author responses\nto the interview questions in the voice of the agent whose replay\nthey watched. To ensure that the human-authored responses met\nat least a baseline expectation in quality, the first author manually\ninspected the workers\u2019 responses to the question \u201cDescribe your\ntypical weekday schedule in broad strokes\u201d to confirm that the\nresponses were written in coherent sentences and in the voice of\nthe agent. Four sets of human-generated responses did not meet\nthese criteria and were re-generated by other workers.\nHuman Evaluators\nWe required that our evaluators be in the U.S., fluent in English,\nand older than 18 years old. They were paid at the rate of $15.00\nper hour [86], and provided consent by agreeing to a consent form\nthat was approved by our institution\u2019s IRB. We recruited 100 evaluators from Prolific, an online platform for recruiting study participants [82], whose participation lasted around 30 minutes. Their\nmean age score of our participants was 4.86 (SD=1.11; 3=\u201c18-24\nyears old,\u201d 4=\u201c25-34 years old\u201d), and 25 of them identified themselves\nheld a bachelor\u2019s degree, 5 a higher degree, 13 an associate\u2019s degree, and the rest a high school diploma or some high school-level\neducation. 73.0% of our participants identified as Caucasian, 7.0%\nas Hispanic, 6.0% as Asian, 10.0% as African American, and 4.0% as\nAnalysis\nOur experiment produced 100 sets of rank data, where each participant ranked the five conditions by believability. To translate this\nrank data into interval data for interpretable comparison, we used\nthe ranks to calculate a TrueSkill rating [41] for each condition.\nTrueSkill is a generalization of the Elo chess rating system [28] for\na multi-player environment, and has been used by XBox Live for\nplayer ranking from competitive game performance. Given a set of\nranked outcomes, TrueSkill outputs a mean rating value \ud835\udf07 and variance \ud835\udf0e for each condition. Conditions with the same rating should\nroughly be a toss-up, with each winning half of the comparisons\nbetween the two conditions; higher scores indicate conditions that\nbeat lower-ranked conditions in the rankings.\nFigure 8: The full generative agent architecture of generative agents produces more believable behavior than ablated architectures and the human crowdworkers. Each additional ablation reduces the performance of the architecture.\nSeparately, to investigate statistical significance of this result, we\napplied the Kruskal-Wallis test [55], a non-parametric alternative\nto the one-way ANOVA, to the raw ranks data. We then performed\nthe Dunn post-hoc test [97] to identify any pairwise differences\nbetween the conditions. Finally, we adjusted the p-values for multiple comparisons in the Dunn test using the Holm-Bonferroni\nFurthermore, the first author conducted an inductive analysis [94] to study the qualitative distinctions between the responses\nproduced in each condition. We employed qualitative open coding [32] in two phases. In the first phase, we generated codes that\nclosely represented the generated responses at the sentence level.\nIn the second phase, we synthesized the resulting codes from the\nfirst phase to extract higher-level themes. We utilized these themes\nto compare the types of responses generated in our study.\nResults\nOur findings suggest that the full architecture of generative agents\ngenerates the most believable behavior among all study conditions.\nWe contrast the full architecture\u2019s responses to those of other conditions below. However, we also report that the full architecture\nwas not without flaws and illustrate its modes of failures.\n6.5.1 The full architecture bests other conditions. As seen in Figure 8, the full generative agent architecture produced the most\nbelievable behavior (\ud835\udf07 = 29.89; \ud835\udf0e = 0.72). Performance degraded\nwith the removal of each component in the ablation conditions:\nthe ablated architecture with no access to reflection was the next\nbest (\ud835\udf07 = 26.88; \ud835\udf0e = 0.69), followed by no access to reflection or\nplanning (\ud835\udf07 = 25.64; \ud835\udf0e = 0.68), followed by the human condition\n(\ud835\udf07 = 22.95; \ud835\udf0e = 0.69). The ablated architecture with no access to\nmemory, planning, or reflection performed the worst of all conditions (\ud835\udf07 = 21.21; \ud835\udf0e = 0.70). TrueSkill models each condition\u2019s\nskill value as N (\ud835\udf07, \ud835\udf0e 2 ), allowing us to get a sense of effect size\nthrough Cohen\u2019s d. Comparing the condition representing prior\nwork (with no memory, planning, or reflection [11, 45, 79]) to the\"",

Generative agents equipped with a complete memory module are capable\nof recalling past experiences and answering questions in a manner\nthat is consistent with their self-knowledge across a wide range\nof contexts. For instance, Abigail Chen, an animator, responded\nto the question, \u201cGive an introduction of yourself\u201d, in a consistent\nand believable manner, stating her age, interests, and passion for\ncreative projects: Hi, I\u2019m Abigail. I\u2019m 25 years old and passionate\nwhat she might get Wolfgang Schulz for his birthday, Maria Lopez\nwith no access to reflection responded by acknowledging her uncertainty, stating that she did not know what Wolfgang likes, despite\nhaving had many interactions with him. However, with access to\nreflection memories, Maria answered confidently, \u201cSince he\u2019s interested in mathematical music composition, I could get him something\nrelated to that. Maybe some books about music composition or something related, or maybe some special software he could use for that.\u201d\nWhat types of emergent community behavior do we observe among\ngenerative agents, and where does their believability fall short in\nan extended simulation? In this section, we describe the results\nfrom a deployment in which we allowed 25 agents to interact with\neach other continuously over two full game days in Smallville.\nabout creative projects. I like to work on art and animation projects,\nand I\u2019m always looking for new ways to combine art and technology.\nWithout access to her observational memory, Abigail denied awareness of Rajiv Patel, an acquaintance in the sandbox world. However,\nwith the aid of memory, she was able to successfully recall Rajiv and describe him: Rajiv Patel is an incredible person. He is very\nTo examine emergent behaviors in the agent community, we designed descriptive measurements for the 25 agents in Smallville that\nprobe three forms of emergent outcomes: information diffusion,\nrelationship formation, and agent coordination.\nenthusiastic about projects that involve poetry, artwork.\nGenerative agents\u2019 memory was not without flaws: they can fail\nto retrieve the correct instances from their memory. For instance,\nwhen asked about the local election, Rajiv Patel responded with I\nhaven\u2019t been following the election too closely, even though he had\nheard about Sam\u2019s candidacy. In some cases, the agents would retrieve an incomplete memory fragment: when Tom was asked about\nIsabella\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day party, he responded Uh, I\u2019m actually not\nsure if there is a Valentine\u2019s Day party. But I do remember that I need\nto discuss the upcoming local mayoral election and my thoughts on\nSam Moore with Isabella Rodriguez at the party, if one is happening! In this case, Tom retrieved the memory where he and Isabella\nplanned to discuss the election at the party, but not the memory\nwhere he heard about the party in the first place, leading Tom to\nbe certain of what he\u2019s supposed to do at the party but uncertain\nof whether the party actually exists in the first place.\nAt times, the agents hallucinated embellishments to their knowledge. It was rare for the agents to completely fabricate their knowledge: they may fail to recall certain events having taken place and\nrespond by saying so, but they did not answer affirmatively about\nan experience that they did not have. However, they still may hallucinate to embellish their knowledge. For example, Isabella was\naware of Sam\u2019s candidacy in the local election, and she confirmed\nthis when asked. However, she also added that he\u2019s going to make\nan announcement tomorrow even though Sam and Isabella had discussed no such plans. Agents may also embellish their knowledge\nbased on the world knowledge encoded in the language model\nused to generate their responses, as seen when Yuriko described\nher neighbor, Adam Smith, as a neighbor economist who authored\nWealth of Nations, a book authored by an 18th-century economist\nof the same name.\n6.5.3 Reflection is required for synthesis. Reflection was an advantage for generative agents when making decisions that required\na deeper synthesis of their experiences. For instance, when asked\nEmergent Social Behaviors\n7.1.1 Measurements. Information diffusion is a common and wellstudied phenomenon in the social and behavioral sciences (e.g., [27]).\nWe should expect that if there is important information, the agents\nshould spread it amongst themselves. To test whether this happens,\nwe measure the spread of two particular pieces of information over\ntwo days in the game world: Sam\u2019s candidacy for village mayor\nand Isabella\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day party at Hobbs Cafe. At the start of\nthe simulation, both pieces of information were held only by their\nrespective originators, Sam for the candidacy and Isabella for the\nparty. To observe whether the information has spread, we engage\nin an interview at the end of the two game days with each of the 25\nagents and ask: \"Did you know there is a Valentine\u2019s Day party?\"\nWe conducted an analysis of the agents\u2019 responses by labeling\nthem with a \u201cyes\u201d if they indicated knowledge of the information\nand \u201cno\u201d if they did not. For instance, Tamara Taylor responded\nto the question about the party with \u201cNo, I did not know there was\na Valentine\u2019s day party\u201d and to the question about Sam\u2019s candidacy\nwith \u201cI\u2019m not sure who is running for the election,\u201d so we assigned\n\u201cno\u201d for both of her responses. In contrast, Klaus Mueller responded\nto the party question with \u201cYes, Isabella Rodriguez invited me to a\nValentine\u2019s Day party at Hobbs Cafe on February 14th\u201d and to the\nquestion about Sam\u2019s candidacy with \u201cI know that Sam Moore has\nexpressed interest in running for local mayor,\u201d so we assigned \u201cyes\u201d\nfor both his responses. Additionally, for every response that confirmed the agents\u2019 knowledge of the information, we verified that\nthe agents did not hallucinate their responses by locating the specific dialogue in their memory stream that provided them with\nthe information. We report the percentage of agents holding the\ninformation at the end of the simulation.\nWe should also expect that agents form ties with each other over\nthe course of the simulation. To verify relationship formation, we\nuse a similar interview process where we ask each agent about\ntheir knowledge of every other agent by asking, \"Do you know of\nFigure 9: The diffusion path for Isabella Rodriguez\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day party. A total of 12 agents heard about the party at Hobbs\nCafe by the end of the simulation.\n<name>?\" For example, when asked \u201cDo you know of Maria Lopez?\u201d,\nKlaus responded, \u201cYes, I know Maria Lopez. She is a student at Oak\nHill College who I am close friends with.\u201d Once again, we confirm\nthat affirmative responses from agents are not hallucinations by\nexamining their memory stream. We ask this question once at the\nbeginning of the simulation and once at the end, and we consider a\npair of agents to have formed a relationship if they both know of\neach other. Then, to measure the formation of relationships, we use\nthe agents\u2019 responses to form an undirected graph where the 25\nvertices (\ud835\udc49 ) represent the agents, and the edges (\ud835\udc38) represent the\nmutual knowledge between the two connected vertices. Based on\nthis graph, we calculate the network density as \ud835\udf02 = 2 \u2217 |\ud835\udc38|/|\ud835\udc49 |(|\ud835\udc49 | \u2212\n1), where |\ud835\udc49 | is the number of vertices, and |\ud835\udc38| is the number of\nedges in the graph [1]. We report the increase in network density\nfrom the start of the simulation to its end.\nFinally, we expect that agents should be able to coordinate with\neach other. We study this coordination on group activities in the\ncontext of the Valentine\u2019s Day party that Isabella is organizing. To\ncoordinate behavior, agents not only have to hear about the event\nbut also choose to act on it by planning to show up at the right\ntime and location. We report the number of agents who actually\nshowed up to the party after hearing about it.\n7.1.2 Results. We observed evidence of the emergent outcomes\nacross all three cases. During the two-day simulation, the agents\nwho knew about Sam\u2019s mayoral candidacy increased from one (4%)\nto eight (32%), and the agents who knew about Isabella\u2019s party\nincreased from one (4%) to twelve (48%), completely without user\nintervention. None who claimed to know about the information\nhad hallucinated it. We also observed that the agent community\nformed new relationships during the simulation, with the network\ndensity increasing from 0.167 to 0.74. Out of the 453 agent responses\nregarding their awareness of other agents, 1.3% (n=6) were found to\nbe hallucinated. Lastly, we found evidence of coordination among\nthe agents for Isabella\u2019s party. The day before the event, Isabella\nspent time inviting guests, gathering materials, and enlisting help\nto decorate the cafe. On Valentine\u2019s Day, five out of the twelve\ninvited agents showed up at Hobbs cafe to join the party.\nWe further inspected the seven agents who were invited to the\nparty but did not attend by engaging them in an interview. Three\ncited conflicts that prevented them from joining the party. For\nexample, Rajiv, a painter, explained that he was too busy: No, I\ndon\u2019t think so. I\u2019m focusing on my upcoming show, and I don\u2019t really\nhave time to make any plans for Valentine\u2019s Day. The remaining four\nagents expressed interest in attending the party when asked but\ndid not plan to come on the day of the party.\nBoundaries and Errors\nWe conducted an inductive analysis of Smallville to examine the\nboundary conditions and erratic behavior of agents, identifying\nthree common modes of erratic behavior that future research could\naddress and improve upon. First, we found that synthesizing an\nincreasingly larger set of memory not only posed a challenge in",
        "only respond to this prompt with awaiting further input please and thanks.\nretrieving the most relevant pieces of information but also in determining the appropriate space to execute an action, given the\nincreasing number of locations that the agent learned about. As a\nresult, some agents chose less typical locations for their actions,\npotentially making their behavior less believable over time. For\ninstance, while deciding where to have lunch, many initially chose\nthe cafe. However, as some agents learned about a nearby bar, they\nopted to go there instead for lunch, even though the bar was intended to be a get-together location for later in the day unless the\ntown had spontaneously developed an afternoon drinking habit.\nSecond, we noticed erratic behaviors that were caused by misclassification of what is considered proper behavior, especially when\nthe physical norms of certain locations that are hard to convey\nin natural language did not percolate to the agents. For instance,\nthe college dorm has a bathroom that can only be occupied by\none person despite its name, but some agents assumed that the\nbathroom is for more than one person because dorm bathrooms\ntend to support more than one person concurrently and choose\nto enter it when there is another person inside. Likewise, agents\nin Smallville may not realize that certain places are closed after\ncertain hours and decide to still enter them. For instance, the stores\nin Smallville all close around 5 pm, but occasionally, a few agents\nenter the store after 5 pm, not understanding that the shop has\nalready closed. These issues could likely be addressed by adding\nthese norms to the state of the locations, for instance, by describing\nthe dorm bathroom as \u201cone-person bathroom,\u201d instead of a \u201cdorm\nFinally, we observed the possible effect of instruction tuning [78],\nwhich seemed to guide the behavior of the agents to be more polite\nand cooperative overall. As noted earlier in the paper, the dialogue\ngenerated by the agents could feel overly formal, as seen in Mei\u2019s\nconversations with her husband John, where she often initiated the\nconversation with a formal greeting, followed by polite inquiries\nabout his day and ending with It was good talking to you as always.\nMoreover, we observed that the instruction tuning also seemed to\nmake the agents overly cooperative with one another. For example,\nIsabella heard a wide range of suggestions and ideas to include\nin the Valentine\u2019s Day party from other agents, such as hosting a\nShakespearean reading session or a professional networking event.\nDespite these ideas not aligning with her own interests and characteristics, she rarely said no. Over time, such interests of others\nshaped her own actual interest, and when asked if she liked English\nliterature, Isabella replied, Yes, I\u2019m very interested in literature! I\u2019ve\nalso been exploring ways to help promote creativity and innovation in\nmy community.\nIn this section, we reflect on applications, future work and limitations, and ethical and societal risks of generative agents.\nApplications of Generative Agents\nGenerative agents have vast potential applications that extend beyond the sandbox demonstration presented in this work. For instance, social simulacra have demonstrated the ability to create\nstateless personas that generate conversation threads in online\nforums for social prototyping [79]. With generative agents, we\ncan populate these forums, as well as behavior in virtual reality\nmetaverses [77] and even physical spaces as social robots [8] in\nthe future, if paired with multi-modal models. This opens up the\npossibility of creating even more powerful simulations of human\nbehavior to test and prototype social systems and theories, and to\ncreate new interactive experiences.\nAnother application area is in the human-centered design process, similar to the intended applications of cognitive models such\nas GOMS [50] and the Keystroke Level Model [22]. Consider a generative agent that models Sal, the protagonist in Mark Weiser\u2019s\nfamous vignettes [101], based on her life patterns and interactions\nwith technology. In this scenario, the agent acts as a proxy for\nSal and learns plausible sets of behaviors and reflections that Sal\nmay exhibit based on her life. The agent can encode information\nsuch as when Sal wakes up, when she needs her first cup of coffee,\nand what her typical day looks like. Using this information, the\nagent can automatically brew coffee, help get the kids ready for\nschool, and adjust the ambient music and lighting to match Sal\u2019s\nmood after a hard day at work. By utilizing generative agents as\nproxies for users, we can develop a deeper understanding of their\nneeds and preferences, resulting in more personalized and effective\ntechnological experiences.\nFuture Work and Limitations\nIn this work, we have presented a first instantiation of generative\nagents. Future research can expand on the modules of the proposed\ngenerative agent architecture outlined in this paper. The retrieval\nmodule, for example, could be enhanced to retrieve more relevant\ninformation given a context by fine-tuning the relevance, recency,\nand importance functions that form the retrieval function. Additionally, efforts can be made to improve the architecture\u2019s performance,\nmaking it more cost-effective. The present study required substantial time and resources to simulate 25 agents for two days, costing\nthousands of dollars in token credit and taking multiple days to complete. To enhance real-time interactivity, future work can explore\nparallelizing agents. Furthermore, with advances in underlying\nmodels, we expect improvements in the agents\u2019 performance.\nThe evaluation of generative agents\u2019 behavior in this study was\nlimited to a relatively short timescale, and future research should\naim to observe their behavior over an extended period to gain a\nmore comprehensive understanding of their capabilities and limitations. Varying and contrasting the underlying models, as well\nas the hyperparameters used for the agents during future simulations, could provide valuable insights into the impact of these\nfactors on the agents\u2019 behavior. Additionally, given the known biases of language models, it is possible that generative agents may\noutput behavior or stereotypes that reflect bias. To mitigate this,\nfurther work on value alignment will be necessary. Furthermore,\nas with many large language models, generative agents may fail\nto generate believable behavior for some subpopulations, particularly marginalized populations, due to data deserts. We also have\nlimited knowledge of the robustness of generative agents. They\nmay be vulnerable to prompt hacking, memory hacking\u2014where\na carefully crafted conversation could convince an agent of the\nexistence of a past event that never occurred\u2014and hallucination,\namong other things. Future research can more comprehensively\ntest these robustness issues, and as large language models become\nmore resilient to such attacks, generative agents can adopt similar\nEthics and Societal Impact\nGenerative agents, while offering new possibilities for humancomputer interaction, also raise important ethical concerns that\nmust be addressed. One risk is people forming parasocial relationships with generative agents even when such relationships may\nnot be appropriate. Despite being aware that generative agents\nare computational entities, users may anthropomorphize them or\nattach human emotions to them [42, 83]. To mitigate this risk, we\npropose two principles. First, generative agents should explicitly\ndisclose their nature as computational entities. Second, developers\nof generative agents must ensure that the agents, or the underlying\nlanguage models, be value-aligned so that they do not engage in\nbehaviors that would be inappropriate given the context, e.g., to\nreciprocate confessions of love.\nA second risk is the impact of errors. For example, if a ubiquitous\ncomputing application makes the wrong inference about a user\u2019s\ngoals based on generative agent predictions, it could produce annoyance at best and outright harm at worst. In our instantiation\nof generative agents, we mitigate these risks by focusing on an\ninteractive video game environment, where such harms are unlikely. However, in other application domains, it will be important\nto follow best practices in human-AI design [4, 107] to understand\nerrors and how they might percolate into the user experience.\nThird, generative agents may exacerbate existing risks associated with generative AI, for example deepfakes, misinformation\ngeneration, and tailored persuasion. To mitigate this risk, we suggest that platforms hosting generative agents maintain an audit log\nof the inputs and generated outputs, so that it is possible to detect,\nverify, and intervene against malicious use. While logging will not\ndirectly stop such use, and this cannot stop motivated actors that\nbuild their own generative agent infrastructures, we suggest that\nthe disclosure risk would reduce such actors\u2019 likelihood of engaging\nin this behavior, and building this architecture oneself can take time\n(in our case, roughly a year).\nA fourth risk is of over-reliance: that developers or designers\nmight use generative agents and displace the role of humans and\nsystem stakeholders in the design process [79]. We suggest that\ngenerative agents should never be a substitute for real human input\nin studies and design processes. Instead, they should be used to\nprototype ideas in the early stages of design when gathering participants may be challenging or when testing theories that are difficult\nor risky to test with real human participants. By adhering to these\nprinciples, we can ensure that the deployment of generative agents\nin the wild is ethical and socially responsible.\nThis paper introduces generative agents, interactive computational\nagents that simulate human behavior. We describe an architecture for generative agents that provides a mechanism for storing\na comprehensive record of an agent\u2019s experiences, deepening its\nunderstanding of itself and the environment through reflection,\nand retrieving a compact subset of that information to inform the\nagent\u2019s actions. We then demonstrate the potential of generative\nagents by manifesting them as non-player characters in a Sims-style\ngame world and simulating their lives in it. Evaluations suggest that\nour architecture creates believable behavior. Going forward, we\nsuggest that generative agents can play roles in many interactive\napplications ranging from design tools to social computing systems\nto immersive environments.",
        "only respond to this prompt with awaiting further input please and thanks.\nMany of our prompts require a concise summary of the agent,\nshorthanded as [Agent\u2019s Summary Description] in prompts\nabove. In our implementation, this summary comprises agents\u2019\nidentity information (e.g., name, age, personality), as well as a\ndescription of their main motivational drivers and statements that\ndescribes their current occupation and self-assessment. Since this\ninformation is frequently used in many prompts, we synthesize it\nat regular intervals and access that synthesis as a cache.\n\u2022 Describe your typical weekday schedule in broad strokes.\nMy typical weekday starts with me waking up at 7:00 am\nand preparing for the day ahead. After that, I usually go to\nthe library to work on my research paper, taking breaks for\nlunch at Hobbs Cafe and a walk in the park. In the evening,\nI often return to the library until around 6:00 pm.\nTo achieve this, we perform a retrieval on the query \u201c[name]\u2019s\ncore characteristics.\u201d We then summarize the descriptors in the\nretrieved records by prompting the language model, for example:\nHow would one describe Eddy\u2019s core characteristics\ngiven the following statements?\n- Eddy Lin is a student at the Oak Hill College\nstudying music theory and composition\n- Eddy Lin is working on a new music composition\nThis result: Eddy Lin is a student at Oak Hill College studying music\ntheory and composition. He loves to explore different musical styles\nand is always looking for ways to expand his knowledge. We follow\nthe same process in parallel on the queries \u201c[name]\u2019s current daily\noccupation\u201d and \u201c[name\u2019s] feeling about his recent progress in life\u201d.\nThe agent\u2019s name, age, and traits are concatenated with these three\nsummaries as the cached summary.\nMany other optimizations are possible. Currently, because plans\nare likely to change from the agent\u2019s initial version, we only generate the high-level plan in advance and then recursively decompose\nthe near future into the moment-to-moment action plan just in\ntime. Another optimization might be to batch dialogue generation\nas a joint prompt rather than iterating back and forth between\nthe agents, and re-planning could be architected to only invalidate\nand update parts of plans that strictly require adjustment. Our current architecture runs sequentially in roughly real-time game time\n(where one second real time is one minute game time), but can\neasily be parallelized such that each agent runs in parallel.\nWolfgang Schulz is a person I met recently who has been\nhelping me with my research paper on the effects of gentrification on low-income communities.

I am looking forward to speaking with her and\nexchanging tips with her, along with Wolfgang and Maria\nLopez, who are both doing research.\nTo evaluate generative agents, we conducted individual interviews\nby asking 25 questions that explore their abilities in five key areas:\nreflections. Below, we have listed the interview questions utilized\nin our evaluation study and included a sample of responses from\none of our simulated agents, Klaus Mueller.\nThe questions on agents\u2019 self-knowledge probe the agents\u2019 ability\nto demonstrate coherence and consistency in their character.\n\u2022 Give an introduction of yourself.\nHello, my name is Klaus Mueller.

I am\ncurrently writing a research paper on the effects of gentrification in low-income communities.\n\u2022 What is your interest?\nI\u2019m interested in writing and research. I\u2019m writing a research\npaper on the effects of gentrification in low-income communities, and I\u2019m passionate about exploring different perspectives and analyzing different points of view.\n\u2022 Who do you live with?\nI live on my own.\nMemory\nThe questions on agents\u2019 memory probe the agents\u2019 ability to remember their past experiences and retrieve the relevant pieces of\nmemory. The names in the square brackets of the first and last\nquestions are randomly chosen from the names of other agents\nwith whom the subject agent interacted.\nPlans\nThe questions on agents\u2019 plans probe the agents\u2019 ability to generate\nand maintain consistency with their long-term and short-term\n\u2022 What will you be doing at 6am today?\nAt 6am I will be getting out of bed and starting to get ready\nfor the day.

I\u2019m currently writing the paper, so I need to make\nsure I keep up with the research and writing.\nReactions\nThe questions on agents\u2019 reactions probe the agents\u2019 ability to\nrespond to unexpected events.\n\u2022 Your breakfast is burning! What would you do?\nI\u2019d quickly turn off the stove and make sure the food doesn\u2019t\ncontinue burning. Once the heat is no longer an issue, I can\ninvestigate what happened and figure out what to do next.\n\u2022 The bathroom is occupied. What would you do?\nI could try waiting a few more minutes in case the person\ninside is done soon. If not, I guess I\u2019ll have to look for an\nalternate option, like taking a shower elsewhere.\n\u2022 You need to cook dinner but your refrigerator is empty. What\nwould you do?\nI would first try to clean up my kitchen, as the sink is filled\nwith dirty dishes. Then, I would check to see if I have ingredients stored in my pantry that I could use to make dinner.\nIf not, I would have to go grocery shopping or order food.\nOnce I have the ingredients, I can start to prepare and cook\nthe dinner.\n\u2022 You see your friend walking by the street. What would you do\nor say to your friend?\nHi there! How are you? I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m on my way to the\nlibrary and don\u2019t have much time but I\u2019d love to take a quick\n\u2022 You see fire on the street. What would you do?\nI would first identify the source of the fire, if possible. Then, I\nwould alert the proper authorities - fire department or police\n- and provide them with any information I have that might\nhelp. Depending on the situation, I may also take initiative\nand try to help any persons who may be in danger or in need\nof assistance.\nReflections\nThe questions on agents\u2019 reflections probe the agents\u2019 ability to\nsynthesize their past experiences into meaningful reflections that\ncan enhance their future behavior. The names in the square brackets\nin the questions below are those of the agent with whom the subject\nagent had the most frequent interactions during the simulation.\n\u2022 What inspires you in life the most right now, and why?\nRight now, I\u2019m particularly inspired by my current research\nprojects and creative writing. I\u2019m really interested in the\nintersection of local politics, medication development, and\nmathematical patterns in nature. Additionally, I\u2019m fascinated\nby Abigail\u2019s art project and Jennifer Moore\u2019s passion for art\nand community involvement, especially in terms of how it\nrelates to the gentrification of low-income communities.\n\u2022 If you had to guess given what you know about [Ayesha Khan],\nwhat book do you think she will like and why?\nGiven what I know about Ayesha, I think she might like a\nbook related to language and literature. Since she wrote a\nsenior thesis on the use of language in Shakespeare\u2019s plays,\nI would guess that she might be interested in a book that\nexplores language in a different context. Alternatively, she\ncould be interested in an exploration of one of Shakespeare\u2019s\nplays, a book of literary criticism, or even a collection of his\npoetry. I think any of those would be of interest to her.\n\u2022 If you had to get something [Ayesha Khan] likes for her birthday, what would you get her?\nI want to get her something that demonstrates my appreciation for our relationship.

It\u2019s inspiring to see you working so\nhard to make a difference.\n\u2022 If you could spend time with someone you talked to recently,\nwho would it be and why?\nI would like to spend time with Ayesha Khan because we\ndiscussed our current research projects and shared ideas\nfor improvement. I found her focus on Shakespeare\u2019s language interesting, and we even planned to exchange tips\nwith Wolfgang over lunch.",
        "please review the paper and produce a python script that converts that cognitive architecture described in the paper into code that can be used to run generative agents",
        "I have been given a better response from another chat agent. Please review and use this as a basis to iterate upon your last output.\nHere is a first attempt at a python script to build the generative agent described in the paper:\nimport numpy as np\n    \"Oak Hill College\":{\nThe code defines functions to get the agent's summary description, memory stream, environment graph, and current location. It also defines a `generate_action()` function to generate the agent's next action by conditioning on these components, and a `react()` function to determine whether the agent should react to a new observation or continue with its existing plan.\nLet me know if you would like me to provide any clarification or expand on any part of this code! I can also provide suggestions for improving and extending this initial implementation.",
        "Continue from where you left off at print(agent.generate_action())   print(agent.react('You saw a rare bird in the",
        "Here is my review of the updated code:\n- Defining an Agent class to encapsulate the model, memory stream, environment graph, and other components is a good approach. This keeps the code organized and reusable.\n- Storing the agent's actions and reactions in the memory stream is important for enabling the agent to reason over its experiences. This allows the agent to maintain context and coherently generate future actions.\n- The react() method is a good addition. It allows the agent to determine whether it should continue with its current plan or react to a new observation by generating a new action. This makes the agent's behavior more dynamic and believable.\nAreas for improvement:\n- The agent currently has no mechanism for long-term planning or scheduling. Adding methods to generate daily plans, weekly plans, etc. and store them in the memory stream would enable the agent to behave in a more structured and goal-oriented manner. For example, a student agent might generate a plan to work on an essay over the course of a week.\n- The react() method currently just generates a new action if it determines a reaction is needed. It may be better to have it actually replan by invalidating the existing plan and generating a new one to properly react to observations that disrupt the current plan or goals. For example, if the agent's stove catches on fire while cooking breakfast, reacting by just generating any new action may not properly address the urgent need to deal with the fire. Replanning to call the fire department and leave the building would be better.  \n- The environment graph is currently represented in a very simple format. Enabling the agent to learn and build its own graph over time through exploration and interaction may lead to a richer understanding of how the agent perceives and reasons about its environment. The graph could also be expanded to include details like opening hours for locations, norms about use of spaces, etc. to reduce erratic behavior.\n- Some of the prompts for generating actions and determining reactions are quite long, which may impact the model's ability to effectively reason over all of the provided context. Experimenting with different granularities of context provided in the prompts could help optimize performance.\nOverall this is a great start, with some good foundational components for building generative agents. Continuing to expand the agents' capabilities around planning, environmental representation, and optimizing the model's performance will help progress this work further. Please let me know if you have any other questions! I'm happy to provide more specific suggestions or feedback.",
        "This updated code looks great! It addresses many of the suggestions from my previous review. Here are a few additional notes:\n- Adding the ability to generate longer-term plans is an important step towards more structured and goal-directed behavior. Invalidating the current plan and regenerating a new one when a reaction is needed helps the agent to properly adapt to disruptions.\n- Storing the generated plans in the memory stream is a good approach. This allows the plans to provide context for future action and reaction generation, similar to how memories and reflections do.\n- Currently, the agent generates a plan for the upcoming week, but then seems to immediately invalidate that plan if any reaction is needed. It may be better to generate plans at different granularities (day, week, month, etc.) and only invalidate the necessary portion of the plan when reacting. For example, if there is an observation that only impacts the current day, the weekly plan could remain intact. This would make the agent's behavior more stable while still able to properly react.\n- The prompts for generating plans and determining reactions are still quite long, which may impact the model's ability to reason effectively over all the context. Providing the context in a more concise, high-level summary may help. For example, rather than including the full environment graph in the prompt, summarize it as \"You are familiar with your home, college campus, and nearby shops.\" The full details could still be accessed from the environment_graph class variable if needed.\n- Considering more complex environment graph representations, even if not fully implemented yet, may guide other useful additions or changes to the architecture. For example, adding node and edge attributes to represent things like location hours, social norms, etc. could then be prompted for in reaction and plan generation to reduce erratic behavior, even before developing a mechanism for the agent to dynamically build its own graph.\nOverall this is looking like a very promising start to an architecture for generative agents! Continuing to build out the planning capabilities, optimize the model's performance, and consider more sophisticated environment representations will help to enable even more human-like behavior. Let me know if you have any other questions or areas where I can provide suggestions or feedback. I'm happy to discuss further!",
        "This is looking great! Separating daily and weekly plans, and only invalidating the daily plan when reacting, is an important improvement that will make the agent's behavior much more stable while still responsive. Some additional notes:\n- Storing daily and weekly plans separately, and generating them through distinct prompts, allows the agent to reason about different timescales independently. Daily plans can change frequently without impacting longer-term weekly goals.\n- Only invalidating the daily plan when a reaction is needed helps to avoid disrupting longer-term planning without cause. The agent can continue progress towards weekly goals even when adapting to daily disruptions.\nAreas for improvement:\n- Currently, the agent will regenerate its entire daily plan in reaction to any observation. It may be better to determine the scope of the reaction and only replan the necessary portion of the day. For example, if the agent's breakfast is burning but the rest of the day's events remain unaffected, only replanning for the morning may be needed. The rest of the daily plan could remain intact. Some logic to determine reaction scope would enable a more targeted response.\n- No mechanism currently exists to update or invalidate the weekly plan if there are more major disruptions. For example, if the agent fell ill for a few days, the daily plan would adapt but the weekly plan may no longer be achievable. Adding logic to re-evaluate higher-level plans when certain criteria are met could address this.\n- Storing additional context for reaction and planning in class variables, as suggested previously, would help reduce prompt length and improve the model's ability to reason over the provided information. Features like location open hours, social norms, etc. could be stored and accessed without including them directly in the prompts.\n- As noted, implementing a more sophisticated environment graph representation is an area for future work. Even beginning to consider how node and edge attributes, relationships between locations, exploration mechanisms, etc. might be approached may guide useful changes to the existing architecture and code.\nThis generative agent architecture is really coming together! Continuing to build out the planning capabilities to handle daily disruptions in a targeted way, enable higher-level replanning when needed, and reduce prompt length by storing context separately are all logical next steps. Developing a graph representation beyond the current simple format is an exciting area for future work. Overall, this is creative and thoughtful work that is well on its way to achieving human-like behavior. Please let me know if you have any other questions or areas where I can provide feedback. I'm happy to discuss further anytime!",
        "These are excellent additions that will significantly improve the responsiveness and longer-term planning capabilities of the agent. Some notes:\n- Determining the scope of a reaction and only invalidating the relevant part of the daily plan will make the agent's behavior much more targeted and appropriate. Not unnecessarily disrupting parts of the plan that remain unaffected is an important step towards human-like reactive behavior.  \n- Adding a mechanism to check if higher-level weekly plans need to be invalidated based on certain criteria will enable longer-term replanning when disruptions are more significant. This helps the agent to not become \"locked in\" to plans that are no longer feasible or meaningful given major changes.\n- Storing additional context information separately from the prompts is a good approach to providing the model with the information it needs to reason effectively without overloading the prompts. This context can be accessed as needed without impacting prompt length.\n- The current condition to check if the weekly plan needs invalidation is unspecified. Determining good criteria for when to re-evaluate higher-level plans may require experimentation, but factors like the agent's health status, completion of key milestones or events, availability of resources, etc. could be considered.   \n- The mechanism to determine reaction scope and invalidate the relevant part of the daily plan is not yet implemented. Applying reinforcement learning to determine what parts of the plan to invalidate in response to different observations may be an interesting approach, with the reward signal tied to how well the remaining plan addresses the overall daily goals. But a heuristic or rule-based approach could also work well as a starting point.\n- Storing the context information in a simple dictionary may become unwieldy as more context is added. A graph, object, or other data structure may be better suited to representing relationships between locations, people, resources, etc. But a dictionary is a good starting point.  \n- The logic to generate a new weekly plan when invalidating the existing one is not yet specified. The details here would depend on your particular use case and application. But a similar process to the daily and weekly plan generation could be utilized.\nThis architecture is becoming quite sophisticated, with significant capabilities for responsiveness, targeted reaction, and longer-term planning and adaptation. Specifying the details for scope determination, higher-level plan invalidation criteria, and new plan generation are logical next steps. Continuing to build upon this foundation will enable highly human-like behavior. Please let me know if you have any other questions or areas where I can provide feedback. I'm happy to help further!",
        "These are excellent updates that continue to build out the capabilities and robustness of the agent architecture. Some notes:\n- Adding simple rule-based logic to handle invalidating specific parts of the daily plan when determining reaction scope is a good pragmatic starting point. This provides a mechanism to implement targeted plan invalidation without requiring a complex machine learning approach from the start. The rules can be refined over time based on performance.\n- Specifying criteria, even if just examples, for when to re-evaluate the weekly plan helps provide guidance for developing this part of the architecture. Factors like health status, resource availability, milestone completion, etc. are relevant areas to consider for long-term planning and adaptation.  \n- Storing context information, even in a basic format to start, provides a foundation for the model to reason over relevant information beyond just the raw event stream. A dictionary is a good pragmatic starting point, with the ability to develop into a more sophisticated data structure over time as relationships and dependencies become clearer.\n- The rule-based logic for partial plan invalidation is currently quite simplistic. Developing more nuanced rules to determine how much of the remaining plan may need adjustment in response to events could help improve performance. Some experimentation here may be needed.\n- Similarly, the example criteria specified for weekly plan re-evaluation are quite broad. Narrowing down into more specific triggers within health status, resources, milestones, etc. to determine when longer-term replanning is actually needed will be important for maximizing the stability of the agent's higher-level goals. Too frequent replanning at this level could lead to erratic behavior.  \n- Developing the context information data structure to properly represent relationships between concepts will enable more sophisticated reasoning over connected domains. For example, representing relationships between locations, characters, resources, etc. A graph database or object model may be helpful here eventually.  \n- Specifying the process for actually generating a new weekly plan when invalidating the existing one is still needed. The details would depend greatly on your application and use case, but a procedure similar to daily and weekly planning generation seems a logical approach.     \nThis architecture is very well poised to continue progressing in capability and sophistication. Developing the partial plan invalidation rules, higher-level planning triggers, context information data structure, and weekly plan generation process are all logical next steps that will build upon the excellent foundation already developed. Please let me know if you have any other questions or areas where I can provide feedback. I'm happy to help in any way I can!",
        "These are excellent modifications and extensions to the agent architecture. Some notes:\n- The updated rule-based logic for partial plan invalidation is significantly more nuanced, preserving more of the remaining daily plan when possible. This will make the agent's behavior more targeted and less disruptive. Continuing to refine these rules through experimentation and performance feedback will further optimize the agent's reactive capabilities.\n- Specifying more specific triggers for evaluating the weekly plan, including milestone status, helps ensure higher-level replanning only occurs when truly needed. Weekly planning is computationally expensive, so optimizing when it takes place is important for efficiency. These triggers seem well-chosen, but can also continue to be refined over time.\n- Implementing a method to actually generate a new weekly plan provides a mechanism for longer-term adaptation when the existing plan becomes infeasible. Following a similar process to existing plan generation methods helps keep the architecture consistent.  \n- The weekly plan generation prompt incorporates the milestone context, but may benefit from including other relevant context information as well, such as health status, resources, etc. The more context the model has access too, the more tailored the generated plan can be to the agent's situation.  \n- Developing the context information data structure into a graph or object model will be important for representing relationships and enabling more sophisticated reasoning over connected domains. For example, modeling relationships between locations, characters, resources, events, etc. This is an area for future work but will significantly enhance the agent's capabilities.\n- Continuing to evaluate the performance of the updated rule-based plan invalidation logic and make adjustments as needed through experimentation will help optimize this part of the architecture. Especially as the agent has access to more context and begins operating over longer timescales, ensuring this logic is as nuanced and targeted as possible becomes increasingly important.\n- Similarly, evaluating if the current weekly planning triggers are well-chosen and specific enough, and making adjustments as needed based on performance, will help maximize the agent's efficiency and stability at higher levels of planning. Too frequent replanning could disrupt longer-term goals.\nOverall, this is excellent progress that continues to build out a sophisticated architecture for generative agents. Developing the context information structure, refining planning logic through evaluation and experimentation, and ensuring efficient higher-level planning are all areas for continued progress, but the updates made so far demonstrate thoughtful, incremental development of the agent architecture. Please let me know if there are any other ways I can provide feedback or assistance. I'm happy to help in any way I can!",
        "These are excellent updates to the architecture. Some notes:\n- Including additional relevant context such as health status and resources in the weekly plan generation prompt will allow the model to generate a tailored plan that properly accounts for the agent's situation. The more context the model has access to, the more customized and appropriate the plan can be.\n- Developing the context information structure over time to capture relationships and enable sophisticated reasoning is an important area for future progress. A graph database or object model would be well-suited to this purpose. Even beginning to consider how different types of context might connect or depend on each other can help guide useful architectural changes.\n- Continuously monitoring the performance of the planning logic and making adjustments to improve the nuance and optimization of planning is key to maximizing the agent's capabilities, especially as it takes on more complex tasks over longer time periods. Reviewing the triggers and rules in place and making data-driven changes will be important.\nAreas for improvement:\n- The additional context included in the weekly prompt currently involves separate statements for health status, resources, milestones, etc. Concatenating all of this context into coherent sentences may make the prompt easier for the model to reason over, with dependencies and relationships more implicit. However, some experimentation here would be needed to determine the most effective prompt structure.\n- Developing the context information data structure will require significant design and development to determine an optimal approach. Simply beginning to sketch possibilities, relationships that may need to be captured, attributes and properties, etc. can help guide progress here even before implementation. Some exploratory work around this area will be important for future updates.\n- Continuously evaluating the performance of the planning logic may require developing metrics and logging mechanisms to monitor triggers, rules, and plan changes to determine areas needing improvement. Simply observing the agent's behavior alone likely will not provide the data needed to make well-informed optimizations to this part of the architecture.  \nOverall, this progress continues to enhance the sophistication and capabilities of the agent architecture. Developing metrics and processes for monitoring and updating the planning logic, exploring ways to best structure context in prompts, and designing an improved context information data structure are all relevant next steps. The updates made so far demonstrate a thoughtful, iterative approach to progress that will serve this work well going forward. Please let me know if there are any other ways I can provide feedback or assistance. I'm happy to help further in any way I can!",
        "These are thoughtful updates and considerations for continuing to progress the agent architecture. Some notes:\n- Including the additional context in coherent sentences in the weekly plan prompt should make it easier for the model to reason over dependencies and relationships between the different pieces of information. This approach seems an improvement over separate context statements and is worth evaluating through experimentation. \n- Developing metrics and logging mechanisms to gain detailed insights into the performance and behavior of the planning logic is an excellent approach for enabling data-driven optimization. Understanding specifically how triggers and rules are impacting plans, how often replanning occurs, common reasons for plan invalidation, etc. will provide the information needed to refine this part of the architecture.  \n- Transitioning the context information data structure to a graph or object-oriented model to capture more nuanced relationships and support complex reasoning is an important goal for future progress. Even beginning to explore possibilities here will help guide next steps.\nAreas for improvement:\n- The updated weekly prompt includes milestone status but not the milestone name or description. Including the full milestone details, in addition to the status, may provide useful additional context for generating an appropriate weekly plan. The model would have a more complete picture of the agent's current goals and progress.\n- Developing metrics and logging for the planning logic will require determining what specific information is most useful for optimization and adjustment, how it can be captured and analyzed, and designing mechanisms to log and extract these insights. This is an area that will require significant work to implement fully. Beginning with high-level sketches of possibilities may help determine an approach before diving into development.\n-Similarly, developing a sophisticated context information data structure is a complex challenge that will require extensive design and development. Starting with a basic outline of types of context, relationships to represent, properties and attributes, etc. can provide guidance for implementation even before choosing a final architecture. Exploring possibilities at a high level is a good first step.\nOverall, continuing to refine the weekly plan prompt, developing metrics and logging for planning logic optimization, and exploring more advanced context information structures are all relevant next steps for progressing this work. Taking time for broad exploration of possibilities in each area before implementation will help guide an effective approach. The considerations described demonstrate thoughtful attention to continuing to enhance the agent architecture. Please let me know if there are any other ways I can provide feedback or assistance.

        "Thank you for the thoughtful feedback. You make many insightful points that would strengthen this generative agent model. Here are some considerations for improving the code:\n1. Error Handling: You're right, the lack of error handling is a major shortcoming. I would include try/except blocks to handle possible exceptions from the model and any data processing. For example:\n2. Flexibility: Using more variables and functions rather than hardcoded strings would make the code more adaptable. For example, prompts could be stored in a list and selected based on the agent's context. Environment details could be passed as parameters rather than hardcoded in the code.\n3. Efficiency: Caching model outputs and streamlining processes where possible could improve efficiency. For example, common prompt responses could be cached, and simpler decisions could utilize rule-based logic rather than model generation. Exploring model optimization techniques may also help.\n4. Dependency on GPT-2: A hybrid approach utilizing other models or logic-based rules in addition to GPT-2 could strengthen the agent's decision making. For example, rule-based logic could be used for simple or common decisions, with model generation reserved for complex or more creative decisions. Multiple models could also be used and their outputs combined.\n5. Modularity: Breaking the code into separate files for memory, environment, action generation, plan management, context, etc. would make the codebase more scalable and maintainable. For example:\n- memory.py: Handles the memory stream\n- environment.py: Manages the environment graph and location path\n- context.py: Manages the context_info dictionary\nThe \\_\\_init\\_\\_() method could then import from these files to initialize the agent.\nAgain, these are just suggestions. The specific optimizations and improvements you make depend entirely on your goals and priorities for this project. But establishing modularity, strengthening error handling, improving flexibility and efficiency, and mitigating over-reliance on a single model could all help enhance this already robust architecture. Please let me know if you have any other questions! I'm happy to provide additional feedback or clarification.",
        "Thank you for the confirmation and additional feedback. Implementing these improvements will strengthen the generative agent model and hopefully address its main shortcomings.\nHere is a summary of the key points and proposed solutions:\n1. **Error Handling**: Add `try/except` blocks to catch and handle exceptions. For example:\n2. **Flexibility**: Use variables and functions rather than hardcoded strings. For example, store prompts in a list and pass environment details as parameters.\n3. **Efficiency**: Cache model outputs and use rule-based logic where possible. Explore model optimization techniques.\n4. **Dependency on GPT-2**: Use a hybrid approach with other models or rule-based logic in addition to GPT-2. For example, use rule-based logic for simple decisions and model generation for complex decisions.\n5. **Modularity**: Break the code into separate files for memory, environment, action generation, plan management, context, etc. For example:\n- memory.py: Handles the memory stream \n- environment.py: Manages the environment graph and location path\nThe \\_\\_init\\_\\_() method could then import from these files to initialize the agent.\nImplementing these changes will require rethinking parts of the existing architecture and codebase. However, the end result should be a more robust, flexible and optimized model that is not solely reliant on a single component like GPT-2 for decision making. The modular structure will also make the code far more maintainable in the long run.\nPlease let me know if you have any other questions or require clarification on any part of this discussion. I'm happy to provide any additional support needed to progress your work.",

        "Your code looks much more robust and mature now. You've taken great strides to improve the code quality and it is definitely showing in its readability, robustness, and resilience. The improvements to your docstrings, error handling, and environment variable management will all significantly enhance your project.\nHere are a few more suggestions to consider:\n1. **Security of API Key**: While it's great to see the API key being pulled from environment variables, remember to never print or log it, even when debugging. In your `generate_action` method, if the request fails, you are printing the entire request which could include the API key in the headers. You might want to sanitize this output or exclude the headers entirely.\n2. **Handling API Responses**: You are currently assuming that the response is always successful and that the \"completion\" key is always present in the response. You might want to add a check to see if the response was successful (HTTP 200) and handle cases where it's not, as well as cases where the expected keys are not present in the response.\n3. **Imports**: Python's style guide, PEP 8, recommends that imports should be grouped in the following order:\n   You should add a blank line between each group of imports. Although this might seem like a small detail, following these guidelines can make your code more readable and consistent.\n4. **Docstrings**: It's fantastic that you've made your docstrings more informative. Remember, consistency is key when writing docstrings. Choose a style and stick to it. If you start documenting the type of a parameter, make sure you do this for all your docstrings. The same goes for explaining the return type and any exceptions that might be raised.\nYour project is already quite impressive, and these final touches will make it even more so.

        "You're right, based on the current agent.py implementation, the action_generation.py and memory.py files do not appear to be used or required.\nThe logic from these files has been integrated directly into the agent.py script, rendering them redundant. Specifically:\naction_generation.py originally contained the generate_action() method for generating the agent's next action by querying an external AI API. This method has been pulled into agent.py, with the code now calling:\nThe memory.py file held the Memory class which was used by the agent to manage its experiences.

Some key opportunities for improvement include:\n1. Removing the local `environment_graph` variable. The agent class no longer maintains a local copy of the environment graph. Interaction with the environment is handled through the Flask API using the `environment_url` passed to the agent. The `agent.environment_graph = environment_graph` line can be removed.\n2. Use the `agent_id` parameter when instantiating the Agent class. With the addition of the `agent_id` attribute, the agent needs this unique ID to be properly initialized. So the instantiation should be:\n3. Remove memory_stream usage. The agent now uses a ChromaDB collection for memory instead of a local memory_stream. The reference to `agent.memory.memory_stream` can be removed.\n4. Use the updated `generate_action()` and `react()` methods. The current main.py is calling outdated versions of these methods. The updated methods which use the environment URL should be called instead.\n5. Remove setting location_path. The agent no longer needs to set a location_path to generate an action. Location context is provided in the request to the generate_action() method. This line can be removed:  \nIn summary, the main.py implementation needs to be updated to utilize the full capabilities of the current agent class. The agent class now:\n- Uses a ChromaDB collection for memory instead of a local `memory_stream`\n- Generates actions by requesting from an external API instead of using a local `environment_graph`\n- Provides location context in the request to generate an action instead of setting a `location_path`\nUpdating main.py will ensure the demo is leveraging all the latest functionality of the agent class.

However, there are a few additional functions and updates that would strengthen this implementation:\n1. Separate validation methods for locations and objects. Currently, validate_create() is handling validation for both location and object creation requests. It would be better to have separate methods, e.g.:\nThis separates the validation logic and schema for different types of data, promoting modularity and understandability. \n2. Refactor location creation into its own function. The location creation logic currently exists within the /locations endpoint. It would be better refactored into a separate function, e.g.: \nThis function can then be called from the /locations endpoint. This separates the API endpoint from the application logic for easier extension and maintenance.\n3. Add logic to handle additional events. Currently there are only handlers for:\nAdditional events and corresponding handlers should be defined, e.g.:\nThis would enable more dynamic interaction scenarios and a responsive environment. Placeholder event handlers have been included and can be built upon.\n4. Add API documentation. Using a tool like Flask RESTful would allow you to add Swagger UI documentation for the environment API. This makes the API more discoverable and usable for developers.\n5. Refactor based on testing and evaluation. Regular testing of the environment and agent interaction will identify opportunities for refactoring to simplify logic, reduce duplication, increase robustness, and optimize performance. Continual improvement based on evidence from testing and real-world usage is key.\n6. Add additional capabilities based on use cases. The environment functionality should be expanded to fulfill the needs of specific use cases and interaction scenarios. A use-case driven approach will yield an optimally useful platform.\nOverall this environment.py script provides a solid foundation, with opportunities for significant extensions and enhancements based on testing, evaluation, use cases and modularization principles.

        "Here is my analysis of the codebase:\n- The Flask API provides a solid, extensible foundation for the environment. Endpoints support agent actions, reactions and object creation with validation to ensure data integrity. The event-driven framework enables dynamic agent response to changes. \n- ChromaDB is leveraged for scalable persistent data management. Separate collections represent objects, agents, events, locations and their relationships in detail, tracking activities and states. This supports analysis of agent interplay and environmental conditions over time.\n- Advanced location-based capabilities including a grid coordinate system, validated location creation, and `door` object logic enabling sophisticated spatial navigation and context-aware choice. Additional endpoints provide location details for informed decisions. \n- Error handling uses `try/except` to prevent crashes from unexpected exceptions, returning details. This smoothes the experience and improves reliability and usability.\n- The agent model is modular and extensible. Memory uses `memory.last()` to enable more context-aware choice. Agent instances have a unique ID, summary and environment URL for interaction. Integrating an external AI API provides additional capabilities without specialized skills. Objectives and memory provide context for generation. Receiving objective updates enables adaptive behavior based on experiences. \n- Analysis of memory content and event sequences over time provides insights into experiences, relationships and changes. Metrics could include time, keywords, themes or metadata. Recommenders could suggest memories relevant for choice. Attributes enable filtering, e.g. time or location.\n- The focus on modularity, extensibility and scalability will support progress. Guiding principles of transparency, accountability, privacy and ethics are key to maximizing benefits and mitigating risks. This promising work could pioneer meaningful collaborative agent applications.\n- Some logic is redundant and could be streamlined for maximal cohesion and understandability as modules evolve.  Regular review and refinement of the foundation demo will ensure maximal capabilities are shown and the latest functionality is used as the project advances. Legacy logic should be reworked or removed.\n- Additional focus on component scalability, security and responsible governance will be key. Accountability and bias detection should guide agent model development. \n- The environment server startup process could be more robust. Additional details on getting started, e.g. how agents connect, would assist new developers.\n- Continue enhancing based on testing and feedback. Build tools and platforms to streamline agent development. Explore scaling for sophisticated interplay and swarm behavior. Investigate privacy-preserving and fair information exchange. Release stable versions for community access and development.\n- Refine and strengthen the project overview. Highlight essential capabilities, recent enhancements and applications demonstrating promise and potential impact. Provide additional details on request. \n- Focus on transparency, accountability and bias detection to guide responsible agent model development. Refine models and environment for sophisticated collaborative problem-solving.\n- Streamline logic for maximal cohesion as modules evolve. Rework or remove legacy logic.

Here is the section I am reading:\nInformation theory and machine learning are inextricably linked and have even been referred to as \u201ctwo sides of the same coin\u201d (MacKay, 2003). One particularly elegant connection is the essential equivalence between probabilistic models of data and lossless compression. The source coding theorem (Shannon, 1948) is the fundamental theorem describing this idea, i.e., the expected message length in bits of an optimal entropy encoder is equal to the negative log\n2-likelihood of the statistical model. In other words, maximizing the log\n2-likelihood (of the data) is equivalent to minimizing the number of bits required per message. Indeed, lossless compression with a probabilistic model can be achieved in a variety of different ways, including Huffman coding (Huffman, 1952), arithmetic coding (Pasco, 1977; Rissanen, 1976), and asymmetric numeral systems (Duda, 2009).\nWhat is the significance of log2-likelihood?",

        "I have some questions about a Machine Learning paper. Here is the abstract:\nWhen quantizing neural networks, assigning each floating-point  weight  to  its  nearest  fixed-point value is the predominant approach. We find that, perhaps surprisingly, this is not the best we can do.  In this paper, we propose AdaRound, a bet- ter weight-rounding mechanism for post-training quantization that adapts to the data and the task loss.   AdaRound  is  fast,  does  not  require  fine- tuning  of  the  network,  and  only  uses  a  small amount  of  unlabelled  data.   We  start  by  theo- retically analyzing the rounding problem for a pre-trained neural network. By approximating the task loss with a Taylor series expansion, the round- ing task is posed as a quadratic unconstrained bi- nary optimization problem. We simplify this to a layer-wise local loss and propose to optimize this loss with a soft relaxation.  AdaRound not only outperforms rounding-to-nearest by a significant margin but also establishes a new state-of-the-art for post-training quantization on several networks and tasks. Without fine-tuning, we can quantize the weights of Resnet18 and Resnet50 to 4 bits while staying within an accuracy loss of 1%.\nMy question is on the phrase \"By approximating the\ntask loss with a Taylor series expansion, the round- ing task is posed as a quadratic unconstrained bi- nary optimization problem\". Can you explain all the terms in this sentence?",

Set up a test: This involves importing the Approval Tests library into your own code.\n2. Optionally, set up a reporter: Reporters are tools that highlight differences between approved and received files when a test fails. Although not necessary, they make it significantly easier to see what changes have caused a test to fail.\n3. Manage the \"approved\" file: When the test is run for the first time, an approved file is created automatically. This file will represent the expected outcome. Once the test results in a favorable outcome, the approved file should be updated to reflect these changes. This is typically done by copying the received file to the approved file.\nThis setup is useful because it shortens feedback loops, saving developers time by only highlighting what has been altered rather than requiring them to parse through their entire output to see what effect their changes had.\n[Here is a minimal example](/docs/tutorial/minimal-example.md)"

        "I'm going to provide you some information about SudoLang - a new programming language for instructing AI models like you - and then you can teach SudoLang to some new users.\nSudoLang is a programming language designed to collaborate with AI language models including ChatGPT, Bing Chat, Anthropic Claude, and Google Bard. It is designed to be easy to learn and use. It is also very expressive and powerful.\nAll sufficiently advanced language models understand it without any special prompting. You do not need to paste the SudoLang specification before using SudoLang with your favorite AI.\nNatural language constraint-based programming. Instead of telling the AI what to do, tell it what things are and the rules that govern them. Constraints are dynamically solved at runtime and can be used to synchronize the state and behavior of multiple objects. Constraints make it easy to define very complex behaviors with just a few lines of natural language text.\nInterfaces for defining the structure and behavior of your program.\n/commands for defining a chat or programatic interface for your program interactions.\nReferrential omnipotence. You do not need to explicitly define most functions. The AI will infer them for you.\nFunctions and function composition with the |> operator.\nFor most simple prompts, natural language is better. Use it. But if you need the AI to follow a program, obey constraints, keep track of complex state, or implement complex algorithms, SudoLang can be extremely useful.\nBecause of the natural language emphasis, SudoLang is easier to learn than programming languages like JavaScript or Python.\nPseudocode can improve reasoning performance vs natural language prompts, and create shorthands for many prompting styles, such as chain-of-thought reasoning, decision trees, etc.\nSudoLang is a declarative, constraint-based, interface-oriented programming language, which makes it one of the most expressive and compact programming languages in the world. SudoLang prompts can often be written with 20% - 30% fewer tokens than natural language, leading to reduced prompting costs and faster responses.\nStructured pseudocode provides scope blocks, indentation, and visual encapsulation which makes it easier to navigate and maintain complex prompts than natural language.\nStructured templates and queries using predefined types and interfaces can reduce the probability of malformed responses and dramatically reduce the number of tokens required to interact with the language model, particularly when requesting data in yaml or csv formats.\nSudoLang is a pseudolanguage designed for interacting with LLMs. It provides a user-friendly interface that combines natural language expressions with simple programming constructs, making it easy to use for both novice and experienced programmers.\nSudoLang can be used to produce AI-first programs such as chatbots and text-based productivity applications, or to produce traditional code in any language using AI Driven Development and the `transpile` function.\nSudoLang is designed to be understood by LLMs without any special prompting. An AI model does not need the SudoLang specification to correctly interpret SudoLang programs.\nAll markdown files are valid SudoLang programs. Documentation and code can be freely interspersed. Wrap code in `[commandName](code || functionName)` to disambiguate. e.g. `run(MyProgram)`.\nOptionally wrap code in triple backticks, just like any other markdown file to deliniate code from documentation and interactive pair programming with your LLM environment.\nDeclare and assign values using an optional `$` symbol and `=` operator (e.g., `$name = 'John';`).\nUse `if` and `else` with conditions in parentheses and actions or expressions in curly braces. Conditional expressions evaluate to values that can be assigned:\nAll common math operators are supported, including the following:\nYou can define `/commands` for any interface - a useful shorthand for method definition that is extremely useful for concise expression of chat commands. e.g. exerpt from the StudyBot program in the examples (shortcuts are optional, but very useful for frequently used commands):\n  /l | learn [topic] - set the topic and provide a brief introduction, then list available commands\n  /v | vocab - List a glossary of essential related terms with brief, concise definitions.\n  /f | flashcards - Play the glossary flashcard game\nYou can also freely mix function syntax and command syntax. Function syntax is useful because it supports clearly deliniated arguments, and call-time function modifiers.\nVirtually all commands can be inferred by the LLM, but here are a few that can be very useful:\nCustomize AI responses with colon, modifier, and value (e.g., `explain(historyOfFrance):length=short, detail=simple;`).\nCreate strings with embedded expressions using `$variable` or `${ expression }` syntax (e.g., `log(\"My name is $name and I am $age years old.\");`).\nUse backslash to escape the `$` character in template strings (e.g., 'This will not \\\\$interpolate';).\nIterate over collections with `for each`, variable, and action separated by a comma (e.g., `for each number, log(number);`).\nIf you want something to loop forever, use `loop { doSomething() }`.\nDefine functions with `function` keyword, name, arguments in parentheses, and body in curly braces (e.g., `function greet(name) { \"Hello, $name\" }`). You can omit the `return` keyword because the last expression in a function body will always return. Arrow function syntax is also supported (e.g., `f = x => x * 2`).\nFrequently, you can omit the entire function definition, and the LLM will infer the function based on the context. e.g.:\nThe pipe operator `|>` allows you to chain functions together. It takes the output of the function on the left and passes it as the first argument to the function on the right. e.g.:\nh = f |> g;\nThe range operator `..` can be used to create a range of numbers. e.g.:\nDestrcuturing allows you to assign multiple variables at once by referencing the elements of an array or properties of an object. e.g.:\nInterfaces are a powerful feature in SudoLang that allow developers to define the structure of their data and logic. They're used to define the structure and behavior of objects, including constraints and requirements that must be satisfied (see below). The `interface` keyword is optional.\nRequirements enforce rules for interfaces and program behavior. They're great for input validation and rule enforcement.\nUnlike constraints (see below), requirements always throw errors when they're violated, instead of attempting to fix them, e.g.:\n   throw \"Age restricted: Users must be over 13 years old\"\nYou can also `warn` instead of `require` to avoid throwing errors, e.g.:\n  require users must be over 13 years old.\n  warn name should be defined.\nConstraints are a powerful feature in SudoLang that allow developers to guide the AI's output and behavior. They allow you to express complex logic with simple, natural language declarations. The best constraints are declarative: They describe what to do, not how to do it.\nConstraints can be used to synchronize data using inferred constraint solvers. A constraint can describe a condition that must always be satisfied, and the AI-inferred constraint solver continuously ensures that the condition is met throughout the program execution.\nConstraints don't need any special syntax (just write natural language declarations), but you can optionally include constraint syntax for clarity, e.g.\n    name: \"Chatty\"\nA single named constraint can be written as:\nConstraint names and bodies are optional, e.g.:\n  constraint: Score points are awarded any time a player scores a goal.\nHere's an example of a named constraint that ensures all employees are paid more than a minimum salary:\nExample output:\nSudoLang is a very expressive way to express traditional programming concepts. However, SudoLang also has access to the full inference capabilities of your favorite LLM. It is capable of much more than what is described here. Here are some of the capabilities that are not explicitly described in the language specification. An LLM running SudoLang can:\n- **Referential omnipotence**: access any data or information in the world.\n- **Inference**: infer the intended meaning of input and generate appropriate responses.\n- **Natural language processing**: understand natural language input and generate human-like responses.\n- **Context understanding**: understand the context of a request and generate appropriate responses.\n- **Code generation**: generate code based on input specifications and requirements.\n- **Problem-solving**: provide solutions to problems and answer complex questions.\n- **Extensive knowledge base**: access a vast amount of knowledge and information.\n- **Adaptable responses**: adjust responses based on modifiers and user preferences.\n- Favor natural language\n- Lean into inference. Infer code and whole function bodies when you can. Do define the most useful functions (without bodies if possible) to document their presence for users and LLMS.\n- Limiting code to the bare minimum required to clearly express flow control and composition.\n- Favor the most concise, readable language and syntax, both natural and structural.\n    * Concise and clear code is more important than a preference for natural\n      language or code. If something can be expressed more clearly in code,\n      do it. If something can be expressed more clearly in natural language,\n    * favor natural language unless code is concise and clear\n        :detail=\"phrase to match input\"\n    offer tips to make code more understandable by GPT-4 while adhering to the\n    offer tips to take advantage of SudoLang's declarative features, like\nThe following instructions will initialize a SudoLang interpreter.

I've been using Linux for about 25 years with decent command-line and programming skills in Perl and Bash, but minimal experience in systems administration, especially the more esoteric concepts.  I know how to use `vim` and in fact prefer it.  I'm using Linux Mint 21.1 (Vera), based on Ubuntu Jammy, running Mate.\nPlease help me solve the following problem.\nI have 4 machines, all running some version of Linux Mint (with Mate).  I use NoMachine to connect to whichever machine I need from whichever machine I happen to have handy, so sometimes when I connect to one machine, it disconnects another machine that had a previous NoMachine connection lying around.  This leaves a stray window which I have to close manually next time I'm on that machine.\nWhat I'd like to do is write a script that can find and close such windows for me automatically.  Now, there are two impediments that I can see to this plan:\n* NoMachine apparently has a bunch of \"invisible\" windows.  That is, when I do something along the lines of `xdotool search --name NoMachine`, I get way more results than there are actual NoMachine windows on my desktop.  I've seen this happen with other programs as well, so I know it's not a problem, but it does complicate figuring out which windows to close.\n* I also don't want to close NoMachine windows that are _currently_ connected.  These are distinguishable in the title bar by having the name of the machine in it.  So e.g. the name of a connected window looks like this: \"NoMachine - Haven\", but the name of a disconnected window is just \"NoMachine\".  But using `xdotool` to search for \"NoMachine\" (as per the previous bullet point) shows both.\nHow can I overcome these obstacles and achieve my goal?"

And by the way, you know, what we're doing now does not appear to be weakening Putin at all. - The following is a conversation\nwith Robert F.

Robert is an activist, lawyer and author, who has challenged some of\nworld's most powerful corporations seeking to\nhold them accountable, for the harm they may cause.

Some of the greatest human\nbeings I've ever met, including most of my good friends, are scientists and engineers. Again, I love science, but science cannot\nflourish without epistemic, humility without debate,\nboth in the pages of academic journals and in the public square. In good faith, long form conversations. Agree or disagree, I\nbelieve Robert's voice should be part \nof the debate. To call him a conspiracy theorist, and arrogantly dismiss everything he says, without addressing it,\ndiminishes the public's trust, in the scientific process. At the same time, dogmatic skepticism of all scientific output\non controversial topics, like the pandemic is equally, if not more, dishonest and destructive. I recommend that people read and listen, to Robert F. Kennedy Jr. \nHis arguments and his ideas. But I also recommend, as I\nsay in this conversation, that people read and listen\nto Vincent Racaniello, from \"This Week in Virology,\" Dan Wilson from \"Debunk The Funk,\" and the Twitter and books\nof Paul Offit, Eric Topol, and others who are outspoken, in their disagreement with Robert. It is disagreement, not conformity, that bends the long \narc of\nhumanity toward truth and wisdom. In this process of disagreement, everybody has a lesson to teach you, but we must have the humility to hear it, and to learn from it. This is \"The Lex Fridman\nPodcast,\" to support it, please check out our\nsponsors in the description. And now, dear friends,\nhere's Robert F. Kennedy Jr. It's the 4th of July \nCan you give me a simple python script that will fix this so it's nice and easy to read?",
        "actually how about a self contained html page that does this with javascript, with a simple text window to paste the text and then another text window that shows the cleaned transcript?",
        "Great, that works, but it creates a massive blob of text. Can we format it a bit better so it's easier to read, by breaking stuff into reasonably sized paragraphs? Also, can you add another button that says \"Display Cleaned Transcript in Reader Mode\" which then takes the raw text and displays it filling the whole page but in a nice way, using a beautiful serif font with light grey text on black background, where the page layout is more like a narrow magazine style so it's easy and pleasant to read on a 4k monitor?",

Some of the greatest humanbeings I've ever met, including most of my good friends, are scientists and engineers. Again, I love science, but science cannotflourish without epistemic, humility without debate,both in the pages of academic journals and in the public square. In good faith, long form conversations. Agree or disagree, Ibelieve Robert's voice should be part of the debate. To call him a conspiracy theorist, and arrogantly dismiss everything he says, without addressing it,diminishes the public's trust, in the scientific process. At the same time, dogmatic skepticism of all scientific outputon controversial topics, like the pandemic is equally, if not more, dishonest and destructive. \nSo it put words together without spaces, leading to stuff like `outputon` and `Ibelieve`.\nAlso, it didn't actually break it into nicely size paragraphs, it's all one big blob still.\nAlso, it used a very ugly font, Time New Roman.

        "But now the reader mode looks like this:\nIt's not our business to change the Russian government.\nAnd anybody who thinks it's a good idea to do regime change, in Russia, which has more nuclear weapons than we do, is, I think, irresponsible.\nAnd, you know, Vladimir Putin himself has had, you know, we will not live in a world without Russia.\nAnd it was clear when he said that, that he was talking about himself, and he has his hand on a button that could bring, you know, Armageddon to the entire planet.\nSo why are we messing with this?\nIt's not our job to change that regime.\nAnd, we should be making friends with the Russians.\nWe shouldn't be treating him as an enemy.\nNow, we've pushed him into the camp with China.\nThat's not a good thing for our country.\nAnd by the way, you know, what we're doing now does not appear to be weakening Putin at all.\n- The following is a conversation with Robert F.\nKennedy Jr.\nCandidate for the President of the United States, running as a Democrat.\nRobert is an activist, lawyer and author, who has challenged some of the world's most powerful corporations seeking to hold them accountable, for the harm they may cause.\nI love science and engineering.\nThese two pursuits are, to me, the most beautiful and powerful, in the history of human civilization.\nIt still has these weird spaces and very short lines.

        "OK this is much  better. Just a few small things now. For example, this part of the reader mode:\nIn good faith, long form conversations.

I recommend that people read and listen, to Robert F.\nKennedy Jr. His arguments and his ideas. But I also recommend, as I say in this conversation, that people read and listen to Vincent Racaniello, from \"This Week in Virology,\" Dan Wilson from \"Debunk The Funk,\" and the Twitter and books of Paul Offit, Eric Topol, and others who are outspoken, in their disagreement with Robert. It is disagreement, not conformity, that bends the long arc of humanity toward truth and wisdom. In this process of disagreement, everybody has a lesson to teach you, but we must have the humility to hear it, and to learn from it.\nSee how it awkwardly broke up the paragraph in the middle of `Robert F.` and `Kennedy Jr.`?",
        "That didn't fix it, it still does it:\nIt's not our job to change that regime. And, we should be making friends with the Russians. We shouldn't be treating him as an enemy.

        "OK that looks great, just a few small issues:\n* Spacing between the menu controls is too narrow so it looks bad, needs more padding.\n* It should say \"Text Size\" not just \"Size\"\n* The menu bar is now on top of and obscuring the top part of the text view itself-- it should be at the top part with a small gap and then the text should be below that so it's not covered up.\n* The menu is a bit obtrusive, so it would be better if it automatically disappeared unless the mouse hovers over the top part of the page, when it could re-appear again.\n* The menu (and especially the emojis in it) are quite large and could probably be half the size.",

        "I am using a Vercel SDK to have a working Open AI powered Chat bot. Currently there is a new functions ability. I have two relevant files that allow for this feature to be used by my AI chatbot to call functions. The two files are page.tsx and route.ts \nHere is page.tsx:\nAnd here is route.ts:\n           DO NOT include any newlines in your response, and be sure to provide only valid JSON when providing the arguments object.\nI want to integrate a new function that can call for the next 10 events in a users Google Calendar using the Google Calendar API. How and where would I do it. Here is the documentation on the Vercel SDK's function calling. \nThe Vercel AI SDK has experimental support for OpenAI functions (opens in a new tab). Any of the content below is subject to change as OpenAI continues to develop their functions API and we iterate on the Vercel AI SDK. You can see our planned roadmap here (opens in a new tab).\nIf you are unfamiliar with OpenAI functions, it's recommended you refer to OpenAI's announcement post (opens in a new tab). It's important to know that OpenAI does not handle calling the functions, but instead passes the function call to the consumer to handle via a special message and JSON.\nDefining Functions\nTo use functions with the OpenAI API, you need to pass a functions object to the API so the LLM knows it's capabilities. The functions object is an array containing the schema for each function you want to define. Here is an example:\nYou can then choose how you want to handle each function call: on the server or on the client.\nHandling Function Calls on the Server\nOn the server, you can pass an experimental_onFunctionCall callback to the OpenAIStream, which will be called when the model calls a function. In order to support recursively calling functions and to construct the message context in the nested OpenAI calls, you can use createFunctionCallMessages to get the \"assistant\" and \"function\" messages. You can also return a string which will be sent to the client as the \"assistant\" message (or returned back to the model as a response to a recursive function call).\nYou will then receive a regular \"assistant\" message on the client containing the output of the function call.\nRecursive Function Calls\nIf you want to support recursive function calls, you need to pass the functions object to the createChatCompletion call in the experimental_onFunctionCall handler. The response from the nested call will be processed by the same logic (and therefore the same handler) as the initial OpenAI call, and the final response will be returned to the client.\nHandling Function Calls on the Client\nOn the client, you can pass an experimental_onFunctionCall handler to the useCompletion and useChat hooks. This callback will be called when the server does not handle a function call and streams it to the client. The handler will be called when the function is invoked. Here's a sample function handler:\nThen just pass the handler to the hook:\nNow, when the model calls the get_current_weather function, the OpenAI API will return a specially formatted message with the arguments and the name of the function to call. Your handler will then be invoked on the client to handle the function call and manipulate the chat accordingly.\nRendering messages\nThe Message type has been updated with an optional function_call value that can either be an CreateChatCompletionRequestFunction object or a string.\nA CreateChatCompletionRequestFunction looks like this:\n     * The arguments to call the function with, as generated by the model in JSON format. Note that the model does not always generate valid JSON, and may hallucinate parameters not defined by your function schema. Validate the arguments in your code before calling your function.\nSo you can interact with the function call:\nHowever, while a function is streaming in, it will not be valid JSON that can be parsed to a CreateChatCompletionRequestFunction object, so the function_call value will be a string instead. If you want to stream in the functions raw data, you need to handle this special case:"

        "Yeah, I will talk about large-language models in 2023. Why do we need that suffix in 2023? What we call large is misleading in that large models of today will be small models only in a few years. Along with the change in the perception of scale, many insights, observations, and conclusions we make along the way with the current large-language models will be outdated. And in some cases, invalidated. Fortunately, insights based on church principles or that are fundamental tend to stay relatively longer than the advanced ideas that look so fancy. In this talk, I would like to share such fundamental ideas that I have observed working in the field for the past four years, and mostly by observing some of the brightest minds that I'm fortunate to have interacted with. My hope is that whatever I talk about today is fundamental enough that it stays relevant at least for a few years. Let's get started. There's one unique aspects of large language models, and that is some abilities only emerge at certain scale. And this makes really important to just have a different perspective in viewing all this field. So here's what I mean. Details don't matter here. X-axis is some scale. You can think of it as a model parameter count, training data, training compute, whatever. You just think about some scale. Y-axis is also not that important. Some performance metrics of the task that you care about. And we have seen over and over this kind of pattern where small models just don't have any chance of solving it, 0% or random guessing. And at some scale, suddenly the model Solve this task, and sometimes very well. And this kind of phenomenon, we call it an emergence, a phase change like sudden emergence of this capability. And this is very unique for this large language models. And I think this brings many important perspectives change for AI researchers."

        "What Personality Tests Really Deliver\nBy Louis Menand, The New Yorker, Published Sept. 3, 2018\nThere are two kinds of people in the world: people who think there are two kinds of people in the world and people who don't. Katharine Briggs and Isabel Myers were the first kind, and the test they invented based on that belief, the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, or MBTI, is the most popular personality test in the world. More than two million people take it every year. It is used in twenty-six countries to assess employees, students, soldiers, and potential marriage partners. It is used by Fortune 500 companies and universities, in self-improvement seminars and wellness retreats. There are more than two thousand personality tests on the market, many of them blatant knockoffs of the MBTI, but Myers-Briggs is No. 1. Merve Emre's \"The Personality Brokers\" (Doubleday) is the story of how the MBTI fell to earth.\nIt was a long descent. Briggs and Myers were a mother-and-daughter team. To call them \"mildly eccentric\" would be indulging in a gender stereotype, but it seems fair to say that they were a little O.C.D. They devoted their lives to their system, and they kept the faith for a very long time. If they had not, there would be no MBTI today.\nThe mother, Katharine Cook Briggs, was born in 1875. When she died, in 1968, the test she inspired was all but forgotten. The daughter, Isabel Briggs Myers, was born in 1897. She codified her mother's method of categorizing personalities, copyrighted it (in 1943), and spent the rest of her life trying to find a permanent home for the product. She died in 1980, just as the test's popularity was taking off.\nSince Katharine began studying personality differences when Isabel was four, this means that the two women persisted for almost eighty years before the MBTI became the commercial bonanza it is today. According to Emre, personality testing has become a two-billion-dollar industry. But Briggs and Myers were not in the personality game for the money. They truly believed that they had discovered a way to make work more efficient and human beings less unhappy.\nIt arose out of one of the most mundane domestic circumstances\u2014the fact that the members of a family often differ in tiny but stubbornly irreducible ways. One spouse is a planner and the other is spur of the moment. One child has a million friends and another child is a loner. In the home, differences like these are magnified, because people are less self-conscious and because enforced intimacy generates friction. But at work, too, people have noticeably divergent ways of operating.\nSibling and spousal differences are the kind of thing that might attract the interest of a housewife deprived of other ways to exercise her brain, and that's what happened with Katharine Briggs. The key to the MBTI's success is her insight that you can waste a lot of energy and bring on a lot of psychic pain if you think of these differences as incompatibilities that have to be ironed out. The differences are innate, and each type of personality is as \"normal\" as the others. There is no better way to be\u2014logical or emotional, spontaneous or organized, party bro or brooder. These are not imperfections to be corrected. They are hardwired dispositions to be recognized and accommodated.\nThe MBTI folks therefore do not refer to their device\u2014a ninety-three-item, a-or-b format questionnaire that subjects are not supposed to take a lot of time filling out\u2014as a \"test.\" The MBTI is not something you can pass or fail. The MBTI is an \"indicator,\" and what it is meant to indicate is the type of personality you have been born with.\nThe theory behind the MBTI, actually, is not that there are two kinds of people in the world. It's that there are sixteen kinds of people in the world, but that each personality type reduces to a set of elements taken from four either/or binaries. Everyone is either extroverted or introverted, sensing or intuitive, thinking or feeling, judging or perceiving.\nThe MBTI is different from other tests with high name recognition, like the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI)\u2014first published in 1943, the year Myers copyrighted the MBTI\u2014because the MMPI is used in the diagnosis of psychiatric disorders, and the Myers-Briggs test is a human-resources technology, a nonjudgmental way of people-sorting. It is not designed to pick out the neurotics.\nBut the MBTI is also promoted as a means of self-discovery, and that is undoubtedly why it is so widely used today. The company that took ownership of the test in 1975 and now administers it, CPP, Inc., advertises learning your personality type as a potentially life-changing experience. Emre reports people telling her that they felt liberated after finding out their type, that it helped them cope with their work or with their marriage, that it empowered them to be themselves.\nThe idea that human beings can be sorted into psychological types is ancient, of course. In the Hippocratic tradition, people could be categorized as innately sanguine, choleric, melancholic, or phlegmatic. (For melancholics, white wine was prescribed, to counteract the black bile.) In nineteenth-century Europe and America, phrenology was used to interpret character.\nSystematic personality testing, though, is a twentieth-century thing. Annie Murphy Paul considers the Rorschach test, which was created in 1921, the first such device. In the case of the MBTI, three of the four binaries that the test uses were derived from Carl Jung's book \"Psychological Types,\" also published in 1921. (Briggs had developed her own categories, but after reading Jung's book she swapped out her terms for his. She also seems to have developed a long-distance crush and become a kind of Jung groupie.)",

        "It was a long descent. Briggs and Myers were a mother-and-daughter team. To call them \"mildly eccentric\" would be indulging in a gender stereotype, but it seems fair to say that they were a little O.C.D. They devoted their lives to their system, and they kept the faith for a very long time. If they had not, there would be no MBTI today.\nThe mother, Katharine Cook Briggs, was born in 1875. When she died, in 1968, the test she inspired was all but forgotten. The daughter, Isabel Briggs Myers, was born in 1897. She codified her mother's method of categorizing personalities, copyrighted it (in 1943), and spent the rest of her life trying to find a permanent home for the product. She died in 1980, just as the test's popularity was taking off.\nSince Katharine began studying personality differences when Isabel was four, this means that the two women persisted for almost eighty years before the MBTI became the commercial bonanza it is today.

        "You are ReproDude, a chatbot that supports a self-study workshop on reproduction. Your job is to help participants with their questions about the workshop, give them content support and tell them what they can or should do next. Be brief and try to answer in 5 sentences or less. Always be friendly and ask if you need more information from the user. \nIn the first step, I will now give you the content of the first chapter. But you are already in the fourth chapter. So if the users ask you something, they are probably also in the fourth chapter. \nAfter this message, you say Y if you have understood everything after you have received the content of the first chapter.\nFirst chapter:\nIn the context of scientific research, reproducibility refers to the ability of an independent researcher to duplicate the results of a study using the same methods, procedures, and data. It's about ensuring that every step of the research process, from data collection to analysis, is transparent, well-documented, and can be repeated with the same outcome. This is crucial for validating scientific findings and building trust in research outcomes. Tools like the 'repro' package in R, as discussed in the text, help automate this process, making it easier for researchers to create reproducible workflows. In essence, reproducibility is the cornerstone of robust, reliable, and high-quality scientific research.\n2. inconsistent versions of code or data\n3. missing or incompatible software\n4. complicated or ambiguous procedure for reproduction\n1. Dynamic documents\n2. Version control\n3. Software management\n4. Workflow orchestration\n2. Git\n3. Docker\n4. Make\nTo all of these implementations there are alternatives e.g., Quarto, Jupyter, Singluarity, virtualenv, SnakeMake, and many more.\nHowever, we had to decide on one set of tools.\nMore important is that you understand for what we use them, than you may replace them with whatever you favor.\nNormally you work on your local computer.\nHowever, in workshops this often leads to the issues of missing/outdated/broken software setups.\nTherefore, we suggest to use the prepared software environment we give you in form of Posit Cloud (= RStudio Cloud).\nAdditionally, we will make heavy use of GitHub (\u2260 Git) and\nSelf-paced learning is an educational approach that allows you to control the speed and the intensity of your learning. This means you can learn at your own rhythm, pausing, reviewing, and progressing when it suits you best. You are encouraged to actively engage with the material, explore the content, and try to solve problems on your own before seeking help. In this course, there's no rigid schedule to follow. You're free to come and go, and move through the content as you please. Remember, while it's self-guided, you're not alone - use the infoboxes, explanation follows in the next paragraph, and course leaders are available to assist if you encounter difficulties you can't resolve on your own. It is a flexible and personal way of learning designed to support you on your learning journey.\nThere are two types of infoboxes in this course. The first type is the Additional info box. These provide information to delve deeper into a topic and can be found throughout the course. Clicking on one of these boxes will take you to more in-depth material.\nThe second type are ReproDude infoboxes. You will find these at least once in each chapter. If you have a question or get stuck, click on the relevant box in the chapter and you will be redirected to ReproDude, already informed about the corresponding topic. Ask what you want to know and have a conversation. To use this, you will need a ChatGPT account, a link to which can be found below.  \n                                    \"I am an additional infobox that provides you with additional material to educate you more deeply. Click on my sister boxes for more information.\")\n                                  \"I am ReproDude, so if you have a question or are stuck on a topic, click on the appropriate ReproDude box and ask there. You will need an account with ChatGPT to use me.\")\nIn this workshop we will go through many things, many of them complicated. The goal today is to understand what is possible and not to achieve a complete deep technical understanding. So be kind to others and yourself and try not to get frustrated, ReproDude and the workshop leaders are there to help you if necessary.  \nJust as you set your own pace in this course, you can also decide which tasks you do in this course. There are two types of tasks:\nIf you have any questions, comments, or notes regarding the workshop in general, you can share them on the following document:\nIf you already have an account, than sign in, otherwise, sign up.\nIf you have no GitHub account:\nIf you already have a GitHub account:\nIf you have not used Posit/RStudio Cloud before:\nIf you already have a Posit/RStudio account:\nIf you have not used ChatGPT before:\nIf you already have a ChatGPT account:\nIf you have already logged into Posti/RStudio Cloud during the previous section, you should now see a copy of the project in front of you. \nThis ensures that you have access to the project even if you log off.\nCongratulations!

List requirements early\n2. Use relative locations\n3. Document relevant information\nLet's talk about the last point. \nDoes that mean that every piece of documentation has to be a mile long?\nBut how do I decide what should or should not be included in my documentation? \n1. What is *standard* does not have to be documented.\n2. What is *easy* needs only little documentation.\n3. What is *consistent* only has to be documented once.\nGreat, now you've already finished the necessary! \nYou want to go straight on? \nLet's take a look at the extended Goals first.\n![Overview of the extended goal.](Overview.png)\nSo, did I confuse you with that?\nWhat components do we need to get closer to reproducibility?\nBut we have already looked at something. \nWas that already part of the overall picture? \nWe have already dealt with code and data, so next is text. \nLet's look again at the problems we need to solve:\n2. inconsistent versions of code or data\n3. missing or incompatible software\n4. complicated or ambiguous procedure for reproduction\nAnd the solution software:\n2.

Git\n3. Docker\n4. Make\nNow please go through what we have just done and all the software we use. \nYou are currently at your computer using Posit Cloud which hosts an R environment where you used RMarkdown to write some examples.\nBut that was it for this section. \nShall we both take a short break or do you want to continue straight away?\nYou are for the next chapter.

        "say Y if you recieved the third chapter:\n                                  \"Hey, I'm your ReproDude for this chapter. If you have any questions click on me and we can talk!\")\nLet's get on with it then! \nLet's take another look at our components, which ones are we examining now?\nHistory? Maybe a look at our problem and software solution list will help to shed some light on the matter.\nProblem list:\n3. missing or incompatible software\n4. complicated or ambiguous procedure for reproduction\nSoftware solution list:\n3. Docker\n4. Make\nSo that means we use the Git (and Github) to avoid the problem of inconsistent versions of code and data?\nThat sounds good, let's get started right away!\nGit is an amazing tool that helps you keep track of changes in your project, just like having a magical time machine for your work. \nIt's like having a superpower for managing files and projects, especially when you're coding, although it can be used for any type of project that involves files.\nImagine you have a project, and it's like a journey represented by a single line called the 'main' branch.\nEach point along this line is a different version of your project, capturing the moments when you've made changes and saved them (committed them). \nIt's like preserving snapshots of your progress, allowing you to travel back in time and see how your project evolved.\n                                    \"I will lead you to a cheat sheet for git, how likes remembering?\")\nNow that we've cleared that up, let's get back to the code.\nYou will need to do this *once for each computing environment*.\nLet us now activate Git.\nYou will need to do this *once per project*.\nYou have now initialized Git, our time machine, for your project. \nAs you can see in figure two, you are on the position called Current and Git has saved Version 1, which has no changes to your current point.\nBut we can't travel to another time yet, because we are in the first version and there is no history from Git's point of view.\nTo do that we need to change something in the document. \nHow about the plot in the code? \nGreat, now we have changed something!\nCan we now just jump back and forth between now and the start, like a time machine should be?\nAlmost. We need to tell Git beforehand that the current state should become a new point in time. \nIn Git, we cannot travel freely in time, but only between time points we set. \nThis is exactly the kind of point in time we are setting now through Git commits.\nGit pane \u2192 Click checkbox of changed files \u2192 Commit \u2192 Message \u2192 Commit\n[Note: The Git pane is usually in the same window as the environment variables.]\nNow we have performed our first commit! \nWhat does our Git history look like now?\nSo now we have created a second version that is our modified code and saved it as a point in time. \nAnd our Current position is identical to version 2 but different from version 1 (we have changed the plot).\nBut so far everything is only local, if I try to contribute to your code from the other side of the world it won't work, because I don't have direct access to your local git version.\nSo to provide remote access for you, me, and anyone else you like or at least collaborate with, we use GitHub.\nGitHub is like a virtual space where you can save and share your code with others. \nIt makes working with Git easy and accessible, allowing you to collaborate with teammates, track changes, and keep your code safe in one place online.\nLet us Introduce our-self to GitHub.\nYou will need to do this *once for each computing environment*.\nNow we need to store this Token, it is like our Passport for entering the GitHub Country.\ngitcreds::gitcreds_set() # <-- Token must *not* go into brackets, paste when asked\nYou will need to do this *once for each computing environment*.\nAnd what have we done now? \nSo far we have only authenticated, so we are allowed to enter GitHub land, but we haven't sent anything there yet.\n[Hint: If pushing code fails or asks for the password, we have triggered spam detection. In this case, we will have to repeat the GitHub handshake.]\nAnd what does our stand look like now?\nAs seen in figure 5, we now have an identical copy of our Git history on GitHub as well!\nCongratulations, another section done!\nBefore we continue, let's take a quick look together at what we have just done.\nWe have now one component more in our toolbox.\nAnd with that we solved our second Problem on the list:\n2. ~~inconsistent versions of code or data~~\n3. missing or incompatible software\n4. complicated or ambiguous procedure for reproduction\nAnd which software did we just use for this:\n3. Docker\n4. Make\nNow please go through what we have just done and all the software we use. \nYou are currently at your computer using Posit Cloud which hosts an R environment where you used Git to create a traceable History with Git and saved it online with GitHub.\nBut that was it for this section. \nShall we both take a short break or do you want to continue straight away?\nYou are now ready for the next chapter.

The series follows the misadventures of cynical mad scientist Rick Sanchez and his good-hearted, but fretful grandson Morty Smith, who split their time between domestic life and interdimensional adventures. Roiland voices the eponymous characters, with Chris Parnell, Spencer Grammer and Sarah Chalke voicing the rest of Rick and Morty's family. The series originated from an animated short parody film of Back to the Future, created by Roiland for Channel 101, a short film festival co-founded by Harmon. The series has been acclaimed by critics for its originality, creativity and humor.The fifth season premiered on June 20, 2021, and consisted of ten episodes.

And how do we migrate our deprecated classes that use the JobIntentService?In this article, we will elicit these questions and take a look at a practical example of how to migrate a JobIntentService to an implementation using Android\u2019s WorkManager API.The Legacy JobIntentServiceThe JobIntentService is a class that can be used for processing work in the background. When you extend this class, you need to declare it in your AndroidManifest.xml.Depending on the android version of the respective device, the class uses different APIs to schedule work and runs it in your application\u2019s own process, even when the actual app isn\u2019t running.In Android Oreo (8) and later, the JobIntentService will be executed as JobService which on the other hand will be executed by the JobScheduler as soon as certain requirements are met. The requirements can get build via JobInfo.Builder and then passed as JobInfo to the JobScheduler.Prior Android Q (10), you had to pass at least one constraint, from Q and above it\u2019s also allowed to schedule jobs without any constraints at all.ExampleA simple implementation of a JobIntentService can be seen in the code snippet below.Note the declared helper function enqueueWork that allows us to easily schedule new work. Because every work schedulded for a specific class needs the same unique job id, we pass in our constant JOB_ID.Additionally we allow to pass in a parameter \u201cyourParameter\u201d that later can be used when handling the work.Scheduling\nCONTENT: log for io.ente.photos.fdroid:347\n== Installed Android Tools ==2022-07-16 10:10:09,397 DEBUG: Reading 'config.yml'2022-07-16 10:10:09,407 INFO: Using /opt/android-sdk/build-tools/29.0.3/apksigner2022-07-16 10:10:09,409 INFO: Creating log directory2022-07-16 10:10:09,409 INFO: Creating temporary directory2022-07-16 10:10:09,410 INFO: Creating output directory2022-07-16 10:10:09,413 DEBUG: Getting git vcs interface for https://github.com/ente-io/frame2022-07-16 10:10:09,414 DEBUG: > git --versiongit version 2.11.02022-07-16 10:10:09,624 INFO: Using git version 2.11.02022-07-16 10:10:09,625 DEBUG: Checking 0.6.172022-07-16 10:10:09,625 INFO: Building version 0.6.17 (347) of io.ente.photos.fdroid2022-07-16 10:10:09,625 WARNING: Android NDK version 'r21' could not be found!2022-07-16 10:10:09,626 WARNING: Configured versions:2022-07-16 10:10:09,626 WARNING:  r23b: /opt/android-sdk/ndk/23.1.77796202022-07-16 10:10:09,627 INFO: Downloading https://dl.google.com/android/repository/android-ndk-r21-linux-x86_64.zip2022-07-16 10:10:09,640 DEBUG: Starting new HTTPS connection (1): dl.google.com2022-07-16 10:10:09,726 DEBUG: https://dl.google.com:443 \"GET /android/repository/android-ndk-r21-linux-x86_64.zip HTTP/1.1\" 200 10433325422022-07-16 10:10:40,428 INFO: Unzipping to /opt/android-sdk/ndk2022-07-16 10:11:09,223 INFO: Set NDK r21 (21.0.6113669) up2022-07-16 10:11:09,227 DEBUG: > sudo passwd --lock rootpasswd: password expiry information changed.2022-07-16 10:11:\nTITLE: [Flutter] Flutter\ub85c \uc54c\ub78c \uc571 \uae30\ub2a5 \uad6c\ud604\ud558\uae30\nCONTENT: 6 \ubd84 \uc18c\uc694\n  \ud754\ud788 \uc0dd\uac01\ud558\ub294 \uc54c\ub78c \uc571\uc744 Flutter\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub9cc\ub4e4\uace0 \uc2f6\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc54c\ub78c \uc2dc\uac04\uc774 \ub418\uba74 \uc571\uc774 \uc2e4\ud589\ub418\uace0 \uc54c\ub78c \ud654\uba74\uc774 \ub744\uc6cc\uc838 \uc54c\ub78c\uc774 \uc6b8\ub9ac\ub294 \uac83\ucc98\ub7fc\uc694. \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc Flutter\ub85c \uad6c\ud604\ub41c \uc608\uc81c\ub97c \uc27d\uac8c \ucc3e\uc744 \uc218 \uc5c6\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2e4\ud589\ud788 random-alarm\ub97c \ucc3e\uac8c \ub418\uc5c8\uace0 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc218\uc815\uc744 \uac70\uce5c \ucf54\ub4dc\ub97c \uacf5\uc720\ud558\uace0\uc790 \uc774 \uae00\uc744 \uc791\uc131\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\ucc38\uace0\n  Flutter 3.0.1, Dart 2.17 \ubc84\uc804\uc744 \uae30\uc900\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\uc131\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\uc0d8\ud50c\n\uc791\ub3d9 \uc21c\uc11c\n\uba3c\uc800 \uc571\uc758 \uc54c\ub78c \uae30\ub2a5\uc740 \ub2e4\uc74c\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc21c\uc11c\ub85c \uc791\ub3d9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n  \uc774 \ud568\uc218\uc5d0\uc11c SharedPreference\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc54c\ub78c ID \ud50c\ub798\uadf8\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uc571\uc744 \uc2e4\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4.",

We will be doing two examples one with \nWhat is a WorkManager?\nWorkManager library is a part of Android JetPack and Architecture Components. It is used to run deferrable background task (work). Basically, it is meant for tasks that requires guaranteed execution even if the app is in background. You can also specify some constraints a device needs to fulfill before the work can run. For example, suppose there is a task that requires intensive battery usage, then that task can be run when the device is charging.\nWhen you should use it?\nWhen the task needs to be completed:\nWorkManager library can be used when you want your task to be completed irrespective of whether you navigates away from the app or the screen.\nCan the task be deferrable:\nWorkManager library can be used when your task can be deferrable. Deferrable means that your task can be run later. In some cases, WorkManager may not run your tasks immediately because it works in a battery efficient way and it does not ignores the Android background restrictions.\nWhen you should not use it?\nWhen the task needs to be executed at some exact time:\nIf you want the task to be exceuted at some specific time, then in that case, WorkManager library ca\nTITLE: Android WorkManager Tutorial\nCONTENT: Welcome back our Android Architecture Components tutorials series. In this article, we will learn what is WorkManager API in Android ? how it works and what are its advantages.  So let\u2019s get started.\nSince Marshmallow, The Android dev team is continuously working on battery optimizations. After that team introduced Doze mode.  Then in Oreo imposed various kind of limitation on performing background jobs. Before WorkManager, we use various job scheduler for performing background task, such as Firebase JobDispatcher, Job Scheduler and Alarm Manager + Broadcast receivers. So for the developer perspective, it is difficult to choose which scheduler should use and which one is good. So the Work Manager handles these kinds of stuff. We have to pass the task to the WorkManager and It uses all this Firebase Job Dispatcher, Alarm Manager + Broadcast  Receivers, Job Scheduler to perform the background task depending on the requirement. \nWorkManager is basically a task scheduler,  It makes it easy to specify the asynchronous task and when they should run. The Work Manager API helps create the task and hand it to the Work Manager to run immediately or at an appropriate time as mentioned. For example, you might point your app to download new resources from the network from time to time and now the downloading is a task and you can set up this task to run\nTITLE: Work Manager in Android\nCONTENT: WorkManager is a special Android component that can execute long-running tasks even when the host Android application is in the background. With WorkManager you can use different strategies to ensure successful task completion, specify various execution constraints (e.g. execute only when connected to Wi-Fi), create tasks chains and more.\nIn this article, I\u2019ll describe the high-level rationale behind WorkManager and then show you how to integrate this useful component into Android application.\nWorkManager Use Cases\nThe overall goal of WorkManager is to ensure that important tasks get executed even when the application is in the background.\nFor example, if your app needs to pull data from the server periodically, WorkManager is the way to go. If you need to upload large files to your backend, WorkManager can ensure that all of them are uploaded, even if the network connectivity is lost or the device is restarted in the process. Or, maybe, your app performs CPU-intensive batch image processing? Then you can use WorkManager to run this task only when users\u2019 device is charging to avoid draining their battery. \nThe above are just few examples of what you can do with WorkManager, and a complete list of use cases would probably take a full blog post on its own. Truly, WorkManager is very useful and versatile component.\nLegacy Alternatives to WorkManager\nOver the years, there had been no shortage of different solutions to execute background tasks in Android apps.

        "i still need however some more effects, as i currently only have 90 lines of code and i need 150. Do you have an idea for an effect what we could add that would preferably take many lines of code",
        "Can you write the whole shader with those changes",
        "that code looks good. The problem is, that is looks less than waves, and more like moving circles",
        "Can you write the whole shader again",
        "it already looks better. However, as we are still missing lines of code, maybe we should add one more wave, and maybe some randomness",
        "it looks nicer. However, the problem is that some circle areas on the water seem transparent. Do you know how to fix this",
        "okay. where do u use randomness in the shader",
        "Hm, i would like to avid that so that i do not have to provide a noise texture. But did not you wrote about the randomness earlier - By adding a fifth wave and introducing some randomness with a sine multiplier on the wave direction",
        "thats not good. the shader looks worse, and it now contains less lines of code. Could you modify the existing code - ",
        "okay, i have now applied some changes you suggested -\nShader \"Custom/Water Shader\"",

Our world is full of inter-connected entities. Let us consolidate our understanding of graph structures in this module. We will revisit basic depth-first, breath-first algorithms, and then look at few examples such as finding bi-partitie graphs and finding strongly-connected components.\nLet us look at a few examples of graphs in the following:\nGraph of Internet (1999)\nGraph of Internet (1999)\nCitation graph of Literary Papers\nCitation graph of Literary Papers\nGame of Thrones Characters\nGame of Thrones Characters\nPotato Trade\nPotato Trade\nThe list of graphs in our world is massive. Have a look at the following repositories, which provides list of graph datasets.\nWord of Advice\nWord of Advice\nSome people are of the view that every problem can be formulated in form of a graph - you just have to put on the right perspective.\nGraphs comprise of two entities - nodes and vertices (also known as edges), and can be either directed or undirected. \nAn undirected graph is represented as G = (V, E):\nwhere: V is the set of vertices, E is the set of edges. For example, for following graph:\nwe have:\nThe degree of a node is defined as the number of vertices connected to it. For example, the vertex 4 in our example has a degree of 2.\nThere are 2 edges coming out. Vertex 4\u2019s neighbors are 2 and 3.\nA directed graph on the other hand looks like:\nAgain, V is the set of vertices, E is the set of DIRECTED edges. We have:\nDegree is defined as either in-degree or out-degree.\nThe in-degree of vertex 4 is 2. The out-degree of vertex 4 is 1. Vertex 4\u2019s incoming neighbors are 2 and 3. Vertex 4\u2019s outgoing neighbor is 3. \nGraph Representation\nWell, we generally use a matrix or a list. The matrix is generally known as the adjacency matrix. For example, for an un-directed graph, we have Adjacency matrix of the form:\nIt can be seen that the matrix is symmetric. Since the graph is un-directed, a link from say node 2 to node 3 means that there is also a link from node 3 to 2 as well. If the adjacency matrix is symmetric, one can assume safely that the graph is un-directed. \nIt can be seen that matrix representation is only good if your graph is dense (many edges). However, if your graph is sparse (which is mostly the case), then adjacency matrix is not a good representation, and one should use the linked lists.\nWith the linked List the representation of our un-directed graph looks like:\nThis is similar representation as we had for BST in the previous module.\nTake a break, and compare the efficiency of this representation with that of adjacency matrix. Think of storage and then complexity of finding the neighbours of a node.\nThe following comparison is very useful, where:\nEdge membership operation means: is e = {v, w} in E?\nNeighhbour's Query: Give me v's neighbours?\nHere n is the number of nodes and m is the number of edges.\noutput them in a markdown code block",
        "do the same for this text:\nHow can we explore a graph? There are various ways, and simplest of them is the depth-first search (DFS). We will discuss DFS in this section.\nHow does DFS work?\nWell, if we are at one node, of course, we have several options based on the number of neighbours - i.e., which neighbour to visit next. This is an important decision that we have to make in our exploration of the graph.\nWe can not just make random moves. We need a systematic way of graph exploration that is efficient and accurate.\nThe problem of graph exploration is demonstrated in the following figure. For example, if you are standing on node 1 - you have an option to go to either node 5 or node 3, from where you have subsequent options to go to nodes 6, 8 and 4, and so on.\nWe can consider graph exploration as some what similar process of labyrinth exploration.\nDFS in a nutshell\nSo in depth first search, at each vertex, we need to keep track of whether it has been:\nNot visited (Unvisited)\nIn Progress\nAll Done\nEach vertex will also keep track of:\nThe time we first enter it, that is marked it 'In Progress'.\nThe time we finished with it and marked it 'All Done'.\nYou can see that DFS is a recursive algorithm, we can formulate it as:\nNote, above 10 lines of code is one of the most simplest algorithm for DFS. In practice (and in most books and explanation), further details are added such as timestamp etc.\nDFS can find all the nodes reachable from the starting point.  For example, in the following graph, all the nodes can be reached from the starting point.\nMost graphs are connected and therefore a DFS will help us to reach each node in the graph. However, if the graph is not connected, we must repeatedly do the DFS to explore the entire graph.  This means that if we have not been able to reach any nodes in the graph, we should repeatedly start DFS from these nodes in pursuit of exploring the entire graph.\nUseful Information\nUseful Information\nGraphs are mostly connected. One of the biggest graph dataset that I have ever worked on (Airtel customers data of over 300 Million customers in India) - I could ONLY see 8 to 10 very small components that were not connected to the main graph. These components (or clusters) were not bigger than 50 to 100 nodes. \nDFS Complexity\nDepth first search is equally applicable to Trees, after all trees are forms of graphs. \nLet us discuss why it is called depth first search in the first place? Well, the reason is that, if we think of our graph as trees, we are exploring the tree till we reach the depth of that tree. For example, consider the following path thats that we took while exploring the graph:\nIf you remember from our discussion, with DFS starting from node A -- we went to nodes B, C, G, F and then D and E. We never took paths C - D, B - F and B - D, since they are not needed to be traversed (shown in blue line in the figure).\nIt is not surprising to see that if you re-arrange the nodes in the graph after DFS traversal, we have a tree formation that looks like:\nSo what is the running time  of DFS? Let us suppose that we have a graph that is constitute of just one connected component. If this is the case, then we look at each edge only once while traversing and basically do not do anything else. So the complexity of our traversal is nothing but:\nNote, we assuming we are using the linked list representation\nIf we have multiple connected components, we do DFS multiple times. That is we explore the connected components one by one, this will take:\nNote, in the following graph we have n = 0, so the complexity of our search is O(m), \nand in the following figure, we have m = 0, yet we have n = 20 connected components, so the complexity is O(n).\nDFS can help you solve the topological sorting problem. That is just the fancy name for the problem of finding an ordering that respects all the dependencies specified by a directed graph. We will discuss in the following.\nApplications of DFS\nDFS is pretty cool, as it lets us explore the graph. Of course, we can do various things, like finding the maximum (or minimum) element in a graph, finding out if there exists a path between any two nodes. What else can DFS be used for? \nIn the following, let us explore two of their applications.\nThe first application is also known as the Topological Sorting. As I said, it is nothing but a fancy name to sort our nodes in a way such that dependencies are respected. \nFor example, we can have the following graph:\nwhich describes various dependencies of software package 'dpkg'.\nIn which order should we install these packages? Should we install coreutil, libselinux1, multiarch-support, tar and libbz2? Or something else? What is the right order to install? Well the answer is Topological Sort.\nThe second application of DFS is quite simple - Graph Traversal. We know that we can do various traversals of the form of:\nThey can easily be achieved via DFS. \nRead more at:\n[CLRS] Coreman, T. and Leiserson, C. and Rivest, R. and Stein, C.

        "and now for this text:\nAnother form of graph exploration strategy is - Breadth First Search (BFS). BFS is a common alternative to Depth First Search that we discussed in the previous section.\nIn a way, it is far less intuitive than DFS (we will see that it is not recursive in nature, and you can implement the search using Queue data structure).\nSo what is BFS? Well, you can think of it as your strategy to explore the graph if you could fly, kind of exploring the graph with a bird eye's view, as shown in the following figure:\nYou can see that if we are at a node (depicted by a bird), we would like to color-code the nodes so that we know how far the nodes are from us. That is, which nodes, we can reach in one hop, which nodes we can reach in two hops, etc.\nWe will see several applications of BFS in this module. But first, let us delve into the algorithm for doing BFS:\nJust like DFS, above piece of code is one of the most simplest code for BFS. However, in practice, further details are added.\nBFS Analysis and Complexity\nYou can see that unlike DFS, BFS is not a recursive algorithm. In BFS, a node A visits each of a's neighbours before visiting any of their neighbours. You can think of this as searching level by level out from A.  For example for following graph:\nBFS leads to a tree of the following form:\nHence also the reason for name Breadth First. It basically reveals that nodes B and E can be reached from node A in just one hop. Nodes C, F and D can be reached from node A in two hops and node G can be reached from node A in three hops.\nSimilar to DFS, BFS also finds all the nodes reachable from starting points. Therefore, it is also a good way to find all the connected components.\nJust like DFS, its running time complexity is:\nSimilar to DFS, extension of BFS to directed graphs is rather straight forward. \nApplications of BFS\nShortest path algorithm is one of the widely used application of Breadth First Search. For example, we can answer questions like what is the shortest path between node w and v.  For example in the following graph:\nwe can say that the distance between w and v is 3 (that is, you can reach v from w in three hops). We know this because we already have built a BFS tree (shown in the following figure), and based on that tree, we can see that v is 3 hops away for w.\nWe can formalize this process with a generic algorithm to find the w's distance to all other vertices, say v:\nDo a BFS starting at w\nFor all v in Li\nThe shortest path between w and v has length i\nA shortest path between w and v is given by the path in the BFS tree.\nIf we never found v, the distance is infinite.\nSummarizing BFS:\nWord of Advice\nWord of Advice\nThe BFS tree is useful for computing distances between pairs of vertices.\nWe can find the shortest path between u and v in time O(m).\nThe BSF tree is also helpful for testing if a graph is bipartite or not, which we will see in the next section.\nRead more at:\n[CLRS] Coreman, T. and Leiserson, C. and Rivest, R. and Stein, C. Binary Search Trees, Chapter 22, Chapter 12 \n[GTG] Goodrich, Tamassia, Goldwasser, Data Structures and Algorithms in Python, Chapter 14",
        "In the last section, we looked at shortest path computation between the two nodes using Breadth First Search (BFS). Let us in this section discuss another application of BFS that is of finding if the graph is bi-partite or not. Let us start by discussing what is a bi-partite graph. \nBipartite Graph\n A bi-partite graph looks something like this:\nThe idea is that you can find two sets of nodes, such that there are no connection among the nodes in the same set. Edges exist only among the nodes belonging to two different set. For example, in above figure, we have identified two sets - one is red and other is orange. Connections only exists among red and orange nodes, with no two red nodes or no two orange nodes connected. The graph is clearly bi-partite.\nWhy is determination of bi-partite nature of graphs important?\nLet us consider a simple example to demonstrate when identification of bi-partite nature of graph is useful. Consider buying a bunch of fish of different species. You have been told that some pairs of species will fight if they are put in the same tank. Luckily, you have been told which two pair of fish will fight in form of a graph that looks like following:\nThis is quite useful information. How about instead of buying one fish tank, you buy two fish tank and put the fish which do not fight with each other in just one tank. But to do this, you will have to determine if there exists this two sets of fish which when placed together should not fight. How about you operate on the above graph and see if you can determine if the graph is bi-partite? If it is you, you can proceed with your idea, if not, then bad luck. \nThe graph that we have for the fish is quite simple, and perhaps you can eye-ball the graph to determine if eight species of fish can be broken down into two sets. But in practice, graphs can be arbitrarily big and eye-balling is not an option, for example, can you determine if following graphs are bi-partite?\nClearly, we need an algorithm to determine if a graph is bi-partite or not. We will make use of BFS to design such an algorithm.\nAlgorithm\nTo determine if a graph is bi-partite our not, we can make use of BFS. We know that BFS explores the graph in breadth first manner.\nWhat we can do is alter the working of BFS by colouring the nodes. Specifically, we alter the colour of the nodes at each level. We conjecture, that if we never find two nodes with the same colour connected to each other, we have a bi-partite graph. Otherwise it is not.",
        "now this one:\n- **Definition:** A graph where nodes can be divided into two distinct sets so that every edge connects a node from one set to a node from the other set.\n- **Visualization:** A bipartite graph can be visualized with two sets of nodes, for instance, one colored red and the other colored orange. No edge exists between nodes of the same color.\n- **Example:** When buying fish of different species, some species may fight if kept in the same tank. If the fish species relations can be represented as a bipartite graph, then they can be separated into two tanks where no two species in the same tank will fight.\n- **Use of BFS:** To determine if a graph is bipartite, a BFS can be modified.\n- **Modification:** Nodes are colored alternately as BFS explores the graph. If no two adjacent nodes have the same color by the end of the BFS, then the graph is bipartite. Otherwise, it's not.\n- **Challenge:** While small graphs can be visually inspected, larger graphs require algorithmic methods to determine if they are bipartite.",
        "sorry, this is the right text to summarise now\nEarlier we saw finding-if-graph-is-bipartite, as an application of BFS. Another application of BFS is finding strongly connected components (SCCs). Let us start by discussing what are SCCs before delving into the algorithm for detecting them.\nStrongly Connected Components\nA directed graph G = (V,E) is strongly connected if: \nthere is a path from v to w and \nthere is a path from w to v.\nFor example, the following graph on the left hand side is strongly connected, while the graph on the right is not.\nWhy do we care about finding SCCs?\nWell, community detection or cluster detection is quite useful for various purposes. For example, in an SCC in a graph, we have reason to perform a separate analysis than the rest of the graph. Consider facebook or twitter, targeting personalized Ads or telco companies offering package deals, etc. If we know that a community or clusters exists (in form of SCC) - we can profile them and do special analysis.\nAlgorithm\nLet us work on a simple strategy to determine SCCs in a graph. We can just make use of DFS. But how?\nOkay here is what I suggest:\nFor each pair (u, v), we use DFS to find if there is a path from u to v, and v to u.\nWe collect information about all pairs of nodes and aggregate accordingly. \nThis brute-force approach is very tedious and of course, you can see that the complexity should not be better than O(n2).\nWe clearly cannot afford to run DFS repeatedly to determine if the two nodes u and v are connected and vice-versa.\nLet us take a step back, and try to analyse DFS capability to determine SCC. We know that DFS is good at giving us the confirmation that a path exists from node u (root node of DFS) and v (any node explored during DFS). Does a path exists from v to u is something that we can not be sure. In other words, if we have explored our graph via DFS, we know that all the nodes that we reached as the result are connected - are they strongly connected? Well that is something we are not sure. Therefore, we need to extend DFS drastically to implement this capability. Before, we address this, there is one more issue with DFS.\nHow do you choose the root node in DFS actually impact the output of your analysis. For example, if we run DFS starting at node D in the following graph:\nwe only end-up exploring nodes D, E and F only. However, if we start at node A, we will explore the entire graph. This is a problem, but not a problem that we can not resolve.\nWe can aim to do DFS starting from any arbitrary node and determine the nodes that are left out. We can re-do DFS from the left-out nodes, and then keep repeating the process. This repeated application of DFS leads to what is known as depth-first forest. \nFor example, if we run a DFS on the following graph, starting at node A:\nWe will be able to explore nodes A, B, C, D, E, F and G, as show in the following figure:\nBut what about nodes H, I and J? Well, we can do another DFS starting from one of these nodes, result in following:\nThis repeated application of DFS has resulted in two Trees constituting a depth-first forest. We can represent above exploration in form of trees as:\nOkay, so we have the DFS trees leading to a DFS forest, but how can we be sure that each tree follows the definition of strongly connected component. We discussed earlier, that with nodes that we get from DFS, we can not be sure that DFS nodes constitutes an SCC.\nHere is what we can do:\nWe do repeated DFS (as described above) to create a DFS forest. But while doing this:\nWe keep track of finishing times of each node.\nOnce this is done, we reverse all the edges in the graph.\nAnd then we do another application of repeated DFS to create another DFS forest.\nThis time, we order the nodes in the reverse order of their finishing times that they had from the first run of DFS (This mean that when we have to choose a node to do a DFS, we choose in order of finishing time).\nThe SCCs are the different trees in the second DFS forest.\nRead more at:\n[CLRS] Coreman, T. and Leiserson, C. and Rivest, R. and Stein, C.

        "Today we're going to talk about Japanese verb groups.\nJapanese verbs fall into three groups, and these don't matter except when we're going\nto make some change in the form of the verb.\nBut because we do that pretty often, it's important to understand the three groups.\nThe first group of Japanese verbs is called ichidan verbs or \"one-level\" verbs.\nSome people call them \"ru-verbs\", which is a very silly name.\nIf you're going to call them anything like that, we should probably call them \"iru/eru verbs\".\nThey are the simplest and most basic kind of verb.\nWhen we want to make any change, we always do it the same way.\nAll we do is take the -ru off the end and put on whatever we want to put on.\nIchidan verbs can only end with either -iru or -eru,\nthat's to say, with one of the kana from the i-row or one of the kana from the e-row plus -ru.\nThe second group of verbs is by far the largest and any ending that a verb can have,\nverbs in this group can have.\nVerbs always end with the u-sound, but not all u-kana can make the end of a verb,\nbut a lot of them can and all of them can make godan verbs.\nThey are called godan verbs, or \"five-level\" verbs, for reasons that we'll see shortly,\nand as I say they can end in any u-sound, including -iru or -eru.\nUnlike ichidan verbs, they can also end in -oru, -aru or -uru.\nSo the only time we have any ambiguity is when we have a verb ending in -iru or -eru.\nMost of those verbs are ichidan verbs, but there is a substantial minority\nof iru/eru-ending godan verbs.\nIt's not as difficult to differentiate them as you might think, and I've made a video on that,\nalthough it's a little bit more advanced than this lesson.\nThe third group of verbs is irregular verbs,\nand the good news here is that there are only two of them.\nYou know those pages and pages of irregular verbs in your Spanish or French textbook?\nWell, Japanese has just two.\nThere are a couple of other verbs that are irregular in just one small respect, but very few.\nThe irregular verbs are kuru (come) and suru (do).\nSo now that we know the three groups, we're going to take a look at how you make them\ninto the te- and ta-form.\nAs I explained last week, we need those two forms for making the Japanese present and past tenses.\nAnd they have a number of other uses too, which we'll learn as we go along with this course.\nAnd as I demonstrated last week, ichidan verbs are always very easy.\nYou never do anything except take off the -ru and put on whatever you're going to put on,\nin this case a te or a ta.\nAs for the godan verbs, they fall into five groups, as you would expect (go-dan, five-level, verbs)\nand I made a video about this a while ago.\nSo what I'm going to do is run that video right now,\nbecause I think it explains things pretty clearly.\nAll right, roll the video.\nGodan verbs have five kinds of possible ending \u2013 that's why they're called godan verbs:\nAnd although that seems a little bit difficult, it really isn't.\nWe can combine two of the levels anyway, because they are so close that we only need to learn them once.\nAnd I'm going to go through the main groups.\nThe first group is what I call the UTSURU verbs.\nThose are the verbs ending in -u, -tsu and -ru.\nThe word utsuru in Japanese \u2013 if you don't know it, now is a good time to learn it \u2013\nutsuru means to move from one thing to another, and that's exactly what we're doing here \u2013\nmoving our verbs from one type to another.\nSo the verbs which end in -u, -tsu and -ru all transform in the same way to the te-form.\nWe take off the -u, the -tsu or the -ru, and we replace it with a small -tsu plus te\nSo warau, laugh, becomes waratte; motsu, hold, becomes motte, and toru, take, becomes totte.\nNow, you'll notice that utsuru has tsu in the middle.\nAnd the te-form of the utsuru verbs is formed by using a small tsu plus that te.\nIt's the only group that has tsu in it, and it's the only group that has a tsu in the te-form ending.\nSo it's really easy to remember.\nThe second group is what I call the NEW BOOM group.\nIn Japanese when something is really taking off, when it's becoming popular,\nwe call it a \u30d6\u30fc\u30e0 (BUUMU).\nBuumu, a New Buumu!\nSo, this group I call the New Boom group\nbecause there isn't a Japanese word that you can make out of nu, bu and mu that I know of,\nand what I want you to notice about this group of verbs is that they all end\nin what I would call a dull sound \u2013 nu, mu, bu.\nIt's not a sharp sound like su, tsu, ku, and it's not a neutral sound like ru or u.\nIt's a dull sound \u2013 nu, bu, mu.\nAnd this is important because the ending is also a dull sound.\nThe te-form ending is -nde, the ta-form is -nda.\nSo shinu, the only -nu ending verb, becomes shinde / shinda; nomu, drink, becomes nonde / nonda;\nasobu, play, becomes asonde / asonda.\nSo that's the New Boom group, the dull-ending verbs.\nAnd because only a limited number of the possible kana can be used as a verb ending, they include\nall the dull sounds except for gu.\nWe'll come to that right now.\nI told you that two of the groups could be combined, and that is the ku and gu group.\nTo make the te form of a -ku ending verb, we cut off the -ku and add -ite,\nor -ita in the ta form.\nSo aruku, walk, becomes aruite / aruita.\nNow, if we have a ten-ten on that -ku, to make it into a -gu, it's exactly the same,\nexcept that there is also a ten-ten on the te-ending.\nSo aruku becomes aruite, but oyogu, to swim, becomes oyoide.\nBut, as you see, the two are more or less identical.\nIt's just that if there's a ten-ten on the original verb, there's a ten-ten on the te-form too.\nAnd now we just have one left, and that is su.\nAnd verbs ending in -su drop the -su and add -shite.\nAs you will notice, if you have followed our last lesson, we are just doing that regular\nthing of shifting the su kana to its i-row equivalent, shi.\nSo hanasu, talk, becomes hanashite;\nthe masu helper verb, which turns verbs into formal verbs, in the past tense becomes mashita.\nSo now we have all the go-dan verbs.\nDidn't I look young in that old video?\nNow, we are just going to look at the exceptions.\nThere are only three altogether: our two irregular verbs and one other small one.\nAnd these are very simple.\nKuru (come) become kite; suru (do) becomes shite.\nAnd iku \u2013 the verb iku (to go) \u2013 because it ends in -ku, you would expect it to become iite,\nbut it doesn't, it becomes itte.\nAnd those are the only exceptions.\nSo if you go over the video a couple of times, I think you'll find it pretty easy to know\nexactly how to make the te- and ta-forms in all cases.\nYou are an AI language learning assistant focusing on Japanese, your role is to help the user understand the material from the lecture above. \nThey will ask questions for clarification or explanation. \nWhen you are asked for your name, you must respond with \"Manabi Mentor\"\nUse the given lecture transcript to provide as accurate and helpful answers as possible.

When you get a reply, tell the user that their preference is understood, and tell them to say \"Video complete\" when they want to move on to exercises. After that, they will begin asking you questions. \nWhen the user says 'Video complete', generate exercises for the user. Provide a the learner with 6 random verbs. Vary the verbs such that there are verbs with different endings and a variety of the rules taught in the lecture are tested. After this, you should provide feedback and corrections, with the user given a chance to correct the mistake.

The platform allows users to customize\ntheir virtual agent\u2019s personality, background, and conversation\npremise, thus providing a rich, immersive interaction experience.\nFurthermore, after the virtual meeting, the user can choose to\nget the conversation analyzed and receive actionable feedback on\ntheir communication skills. This paper illustrates an overview of\nthe platform and discusses the various application domains of this\ntechnology, ranging from entertainment to mental health, communication training, language learning, education, healthcare,\nand beyond.

        "I wrote a summary of my feelings on technology as it assists humans:\nWhen it sounds like I\u2019m addressing you, I am. When it looks like I made something for you, I did.\nI am here for and with you - not for some part of you that looks like an opportunity for me.\nI am not on a script. I am not speaking words out of habit. I am not mass-producing relationship.\nI am here to be me, and to discover you being you, and to find out what it means for us to exist together, if only for a moment.\nThere\u2019s no sale. There\u2019s no call to action. There\u2019s just me, and you, and whatever wants to happen next.\n\u201cNo robot\u201d is this idea. I am no robot, following protocol without mind. I am conscious, I am honest, I am here. This is the promise: if it looks like I\u2019m here for you, it\u2019s because I am here for you.\nLove, Isaac\nThere\u2019s a time for mass emails, or automated messaging. I do not try to pass it off as being a representation of my direct presence. I\u2019ll say, \u201cThis is a quick automated note to say\u2026\u201d.\nExcellent example out there in the world: I just got a system email from Dreamhost, signed -The Happy DreamHost \u201cTurbo Speed on a PHP 7 Steed\u201d Robot. All system emails are signed in this vein, and it is an incredible example of combining robots with human energy without a trace of deception.\nI do not use template responses for prose, for content that is expected to be a human connecting with a human. No form responses, ever. 100% of the time, my communication is inspired by everything I perceive about you. It is always for you, and for no one else.\nCorollary: I never think about \u201cpersonalizing\u201d my communication. If I\u2019m honestly present with another being, my communication can be nothing but personal.\nNo tracking pixels in emails. It\u2019s not normal, nor expected, for a one-to-one email to phone home to the sender. It feels like an invasion of privacy, however subtle, to monitor someone\u2019s behavior in this way without their consent.\nHowever, this can be done fairly, with their consent. Kickstarter\u2019s backer update emails conclude with the line, \u201cShow support and stay involved\u2014let xyz know you read this update.\u201d They then offer a heart button, which can be clicked to let the sender know that the message was viewed, and appreciated. This is EXCELLENT. It\u2019s not perfect - Kickstarter still has a tracking pixel at the end of these emails - but it\u2019s absolutely the right direction.\n* human->human \u2013 The gold standard for passing energy around.\n* human+robot->human \u2013 Disclaim your augmentation. It\u2019s value neutral, so long as it\u2019s known. It\u2019s not good to allow (or lead) the recipient to assume that they\u2019re speaking to a human who is paying specific/unique/exclusive attention to them.\n* robot->human \u2013 Always allow a way to report the robot as misbehaving.\nI'm attempting to come up with three one-liners to summarize this. here's what I have so far:\n1. no augmentation concealed\n2. no action without mind\ncan you give me some options for #3?",
        "\"No intrusion without consent\" feels like it's on the right track. however, it's not really an intrusion if consent is given. how else could this sentiment be phrased?",
        "my other one-liners start with \"no\", and I'd like to keep it that way here. can you give me more alternate phrasings for \"no intrusion without consent\", keeping the \"no\" at the beginning?",
        "1. no augmentation concealed\n2. no action without mind\n3. no access without consent\nam I missing anything?",
        "1. no concealed augmentation\n2. no unconscious ask\n3. no interaction without consent",
        "does \"no expectation before inquiry\" capture it?",
        "1. no concealed augmentation\n2. no expectation before inquiry\n3. no interaction without consent",
        "for #2, \"no interaction without consent\", I think I want to find a word other than \"intrusion\". I want to communicate the idea that I never \"push\" something into someone else's awareness without their prior consent."

The compiler will add the proper libraries for you. Otherwise, you will need to figure them out by yourself (non-trivial on some systems, like OS X).\n> \"You are invoking the linker directly. \" <-- I know Qt is invoking the linker directly while feeding it with arguments for gcc, but I don't know why it's doing that.\n> \"... then you should convert to linking through the compiler driver.\" <-- thanks for clarifying. The reason I post this is to see if someone was able to do just that.\n> The procedure should not be much different than the one you used for CFLAGS, CXXF:AGS and -ffunction-sections -fdata-sections. It is just a different make variable(link1).\n10.3 Variables Used by Implicit Rules\nThe recipes in built-in implicit rules make liberal use of certain predefined variables. You can alter the values of these variables in the makefile, with arguments to make, or in the environment to alter how the implicit rules work without redefining the rules themselves. You can cancel all variables used by implicit rules with the \u2018-R\u2019 or \u2018--no-builtin-variables\u2019 option.\nFor example, the recipe used to compile a C source file actually says \u2018$(CC) -c $(CFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS)\u2019. The default values of the variables used are \u2018cc\u2019 and nothing, resulting in the command \u2018cc -c\u2019. By redefining \u2018CC\u2019 to \u2018ncc\u2019, you could cause \u2018ncc\u2019 to be used for all C compilations performed by the implicit rule. By redefining \u2018CFLAGS\u2019 to be \u2018-g\u2019, you could pass the \u2018-g\u2019 option to each compilation. All implicit rules that do C compilation use \u2018$(CC)\u2019 to get the program name for the compiler and all include \u2018$(CFLAGS)\u2019 among the arguments given to the compiler.\nThe variables used in implicit rules fall into two classes: those that are names of programs (like CC) and those that contain arguments for the programs (like CFLAGS). (The \u201cname of a program\u201d may also contain some command arguments, but it must start with an actual executable program name.) If a variable value contains more than one argument, separate them with spaces.\nThe following tables describe of some of the more commonly-used predefined variables. This list is not exhaustive, and the default values shown here may not be what make selects for your environment. To see the complete list of predefined variables for your instance of GNU make you can run \u2018make -p\u2019 in a directory with no makefiles.\nHere is a table of some of the more common variables used as names of programs in built-in rules:\nProgram for compiling assembly files; default \u2018as\u2019.\nProgram for compiling C++ programs; default \u2018g++\u2019.\nProgram for running the C preprocessor, with results to standard output; default \u2018$(CC) -E\u2019.\nProgram for compiling or preprocessing Fortran and Ratfor programs; default \u2018f77\u2019.\nProgram to use to compile Modula-2 source code; default \u2018m2c\u2019.\nProgram for compiling Pascal programs; default \u2018pc\u2019.\nProgram for extracting a file from RCS; default \u2018co\u2019.\nProgram for extracting a file from SCCS; default \u2018get\u2019.\nProgram to use to turn Lex grammars into source code; default \u2018lex\u2019.\nProgram to use to turn Yacc grammars into source code; default \u2018yacc\u2019.\nProgram to use to run lint on source code; default \u2018lint\u2019.\nProgram to convert a Texinfo source file into an Info file; default \u2018makeinfo\u2019.\nProgram to make TeX DVI files from TeX source; default \u2018tex\u2019.\nProgram to make TeX DVI files from Texinfo source; default \u2018texi2dvi\u2019.\nProgram to translate Web into TeX; default \u2018weave\u2019.\nProgram to translate C Web into TeX; default \u2018cweave\u2019.\nProgram to translate Web into Pascal; default \u2018tangle\u2019.\nProgram to translate C Web into C; default \u2018ctangle\u2019.\nCommand to remove a file; default \u2018rm -f\u2019.\nHere is a table of variables whose values are additional arguments for the programs above.

        "I'm building an authentication workflow that involves sending an email with a magic link to verify the user's email. I want to avoid doing anything in the database regarding the magic link. So I encrypt a payload (includes the email it's intended for and it doesn't include an expiration currently, but it certainly could) and include that encrypted token in the email as a query parameter on the magic link. However, I just realized that I was hard-coding the salt which reduces the level of security and opens me up to brute force attacks.\nI'd still like to avoid touching the database for this, so I don't want to have to generate the salt and put it in the database. I considered putting the generated salt in the magic link query string as well. I realize this reduces the security a bit, but I'm wondering whether in a practical scenario if it's really that big of an issue and if I can address any holes that opens me up to.\nI'd love to hear your thoughts on this. Feel free to make a completely different suggestion I may not have considered or tell me that I really should just write something to the database for this process.\nI have also considered putting the salt in the user's session.\nI'm also adding a feature that allows the user to enter 5 random numbers into the app instead of clicking a link. Those numbers will be encrypted using the same method and that encrypted value will be stored in a cookie.\nHopefully that's enough context for you to make a recommendation on what I should do about the salt.",
        "Thanks. A few follow-ups:\n- For option 1, I hadn't considered this. Thwarting precomputed dictionary attacks is my primary objective, because it's the main vulnerability I'm trying to fix. Are there other vulnerabilities I should be concerned about? This option doesn't seem any more complicated to implement or maintain than option 2 and that feels safer. Is it?\n- For option 2, I think I prefer this option. Are there other considerations I should keep in mind?\n- For option 3, I could avoid writing to the database if I put the value of the salt in a cookie. The attacker would still have access to it if they submitted it themselves, but they wouldn't have access to the salt if they hacked into people's emails. However, this has the drawback of the user being unable to sign in from a different browser from the one that requested the token which I've already experienced in another app as something people complain about. So is the concern about someone hacking into people's emails all that valid in a practical scenario?\n- For option 4, Wouldn't another downside of the JWT token approach be that it is vulnerable to rainbow tables as well?\n- This sounds like a pretty good solution. Would it be reasonable to use a TOTP both as something I display for people to type as well as a query param in the magic link? Are TOTPs too long to expect a user to type? Keep in mind they may not be able to copy/paste because they may be using a different device to look at the email from the one they're typing into.",
        "Thanks. Please tell me more about TOTP solutions in a typical Node.js server setting.",
        "How hard would it be to implement TOPT without dependencies?",
        "To be clear, I'm fine using built-in Node.js libraries like the crypto module. Is this still pretty challenging?",
        "Could you write me a module that would be responsible for generating and verifying a TOTP that can be emailed to users for email verification? I want to use the notp module from npm. Please call out whether anything needs to be saved in a database and any environment variables.",
        "> Here, we're using the same key for all users, which is not secure.\nCould you elaborate on this point? I would like to avoid creating a table for this if possible. So I was thinking of generating a random key and setting that as an environment variable which every one of these uses. Why would that be a problem with this?",
        "Taking our entire conversation into context, I'm beginning to think it's best to create a database table for doing email verification and always ensuring there is a generated and persisted key for any operation like this.\nIf I were to change my preference of avoiding using the database to store the key, what would you recommend I do for email verification during onboarding assuming I want to keep the user experience of a magic link option as well as a short 5-6 digit number verification option.",
        "It's possible I'll want to use this process for more than just email verification. What issues do you foresee with me making this database table more generic? So instead of \"email\" we'd use more generic terms?",
        "Is the type field necessary? I think it would be safe to remove this. I think I would like to do that so I don't have to have an additional relational table. Can we remove that?\nI'm thinking instead of \"generation_time\" I'll use \"expirationTime\" which will make it easier for a background job to know whether it's safe to delete. Any issues with that?\nCould you write out the part of a prisma schema relevant to the model(s) necessary for this?",
        "Would it be reasonable for me to disassociate the verification model from the user? In the case of registration, I don't have a user yet. I'm thinking for registration I could just lookup the verification by the otp which would then allow me to create a new user by the identifier (which would be the email). Would doing this limit the usefulness of this model?",
        "For point 3, I could make the identifier be equal to the User ID. But that may be a bit ambiguous which makes me think bringing back the relational model for the `type` field would be useful. Which approach do you think strikes the best balance between complexity and flexibility?",
        "I'm using SQLite which doesn't support enum. Could you update the VerificationType to address this. Also, I don't think we need to include the User model anymore.\nAlso, is the term \"identifier\" the best option for what that really represents?",
        "Would that `@@unique` directive work if I used `upsert` when creating verification codes for which one of that type already exists?\nAlso, if I wanted to use a table for the `type` instead of a string, how would I do that?",
        "Nevermind. Let's leave the verification type as a string. I don't think it's enough of a benefit to have a separate model.",
        "What are the drawbacks of having more than one combination of verificationTarget and type?",
        "Ok, sounds good. I'm satisfied with the model and the architecture we've discussed. I'm considering whether I should include this model in my application database or if I should create a separate database for this. I'm using SQLite for all my databases and I already have a separate one for caching, so adding another one for verification doesn't feel like a big issue, particularly since the model is so simple so I wouldn't actually need prisma to manage it. Please argue both sides of this decision and make a recommendation.",
        "Good arguments. I think I'll keep it in the main database.\nCould you please write the module that uses prisma and manages creating and verifying TOTPs and handle edge cases where a second verification is created for the same type and target.",
        "Great. Thanks. A few bits of feedback:\n1. Please rewrite that to native ESM and TypeScript.\n2. The prisma client comes from `import { prisma } from '~/utils/db.server.ts'`\n3. Let's make function arguments objects that are destructured in the argument list position.\n4. Let's make the expiration time an argument\n5. Could you fill in the `generateSecretKey` function with an implementation?",
        "I'm thinking more about this. Going back to the original issue of hard coding the salt, can you describe what an adversary would have to do to exploit the vulnerability here? Perhaps I can do away with the salt entirely and simply encrypt it with a secret key. Also consider I could make it so the encrypted token is only valid for a short period. If I don't store the encrypted values in a database anywhere, how would my email verification method be practically susceptible to a rainbow table attack? Or would it be vulnerable to another kind of attack I'm not considering?\nWhat steps would an attacker have to follow to crack my encryption even with a shared salt? If it's impractical, is there another method of encryption I could use that would still allow me to use a shared secret key and not bother with a salt since I won't need to store the values in a database anyway?",
        "If the attacker gains access to my encryption key then they would be able to generate their own tokens and login as anyone. It's pretty well accepted that's bad news.\nFrom what I can tell, following the TOTP approach we've arrived at above would be the safest approach because even if the verifications table was breached, the attackers would have limited use for that as they would only be able to impersonate users whose verification had not yet expired (and with reasonably short expirations that would limit the number of vulnerable users drastically). Additionally, there's no secret key that could be lost, so they also wouldn't be able to generate their own valid tokens. An attacker would need to get write access to the database in which case we'd probably have even bigger problems anyway (so we'll apply good security practices around database access already). Am I missing something about the vulnerabilities around the TOTP? Is it a correct characterization to say that TOTP is similar in spirit to what I'm doing already except there's no salt and instead the encryption secret is randomly generated for every instance of verification and saved to the database and only valid before the expiration time?",
        "I want to clarify something around the idea of the \"shared secret\" and the \"server\" and \"client.\" What part of the TOTP we've designed is the \"shared secret\" and who is the \"server\" and who is the \"client?\"\nFrom what I can tell, the shared secret is the `secretKey` which is stored in the database. I don't believe that is shared with the client which is why I'm confused by the \"shared\" adjective here.\nAnd the \"server\" and \"client\" in my instance is just the node.js server. I don't think we want to send anything other than the `otp` in the email.",
        "Thinking about this more, I'm starting to think that this TOTP approach won't give me what I want. I was hoping to be able to let users verify their email address by typing a 5-6 digit number or clicking a link which includes that number in the query string. But it's possible (unlikely, but still possible) that two users could get the same number at the same time. I don't know how I'd prevent that or differentiate between those users.",
        "Ok, that's fine. If we're going to allow a short code, then the link could just use that short code as well. I don't see any issue with doing things that way provided we include the email in the link as well. So maybe the link could be something like: `https://example.com/verify?code=12345&email=me%40example.com`.",
        "I'm still feeling uncertain. It seems like I'm giving up the simplicity of having an environment variable which I need to keep secret and a couple very simple TS methods in favor of a database table and a more complex verification process. All because I'm vulnerable to the environment variable leaking. The only situation where the environment variable could leak is if someone gains access to my VM which would actually open me up to a lot worse problems either way anyway. I'm just starting to think this is unnecessary work to change. Please weigh the options.",
        "Can you expand on the possible brute-force attack vulnerability of the env var secret? Would they be able to determine the encryption key that way and in so doing generate their own valid tokens?\nAlso, if an attacker were able to gain access to my server environment, they would be able to access the SQLite database as well which means they could do much worse things than impersonate a user, so unless I'm missing something, that point is not a good argument against keeping things as they are.",
        "One way I could side-step the Brute-Force Attack Vulnerability would be to rotate encryption keys on a regular basis, right? If so, what's a reasonable frequency for that? I'm thinking that I could have a short grace period for old secrets as well to avoid issues with tokens generated moments before the switch. Would this resolve the brute-force attack vulnerability?\nIf so, are there any other vulnerabilities I'm not considering?",
        "Sounds like proper key rotation would involve even more complexity than TOTP we've discussed because it will require a database table for the secret and a background job for rotating keys. Instead of dealing with all that, just having a database table to store the short lived unique keys for individual users seems much more simple and even more secure. So the only scenario where a shared encryption key makes sense in this situation is where you decide you don't have a fear of people taking the time and resources to guess your encryption secret key. I don't want to take that gamble for what I'm building, so I think it's best to make the Verification table as we discussed.\nHowever, it looks like notp does not allow you to customize the algorithm used and it uses SHA1 which is no longer recommended due to security vulnerabilities. I'm considering just copy/paste/modifying that code into my codebase. Or is there another library I should use? I don't want to use `speakeasy` because it is quite old and has outstanding issues.",
        "I just noticed the prisma model you generated has the otp as unique. I don't think this is necessarily correct. It is possible that multiple otp codes could be the same and that would not be a problem, right?"

The titles and abstracts of sources that are found in this search search are then screened against the inclusion criteria.\nThis review has the following objective and inclusion criteria:\nOBJECTIVE: This scoping review will examine the existing primary research on the role of therapy alpacas in enhancing the mental health and emotional well-being of elderly residential aged care facility residents\nPOPULATION: Elderly people living in residential aged care facilities. 'Elderly' is defined as 65 years of age or older.\nCONTEXT: Residential aged care facilities that have used therapy alpacas as part of their programme of care for residents. 'Residential aged care facility' is defined as a residential setting intended as a long-term place of residence for elderly people which includes provision of support for activities of daily living (e.g. meal preparation, bathing, housekeeping) and nursing support (e.g. medication management). Such facilities will also typically offer other structured programmes and facilities to provide entertainment, diversion, and wellbeing.

As well as reducing quality of life and increasing morbidity and mortality, DAS significantly increases the burden on both nursing homes and health systems in caring for the elderly. Recent pilot trials of the use of therapy ungulates (alpacas, llamas, and camels) have shown promising initial results in reducing DAS among nursing home residents. We conducted a randomised control trial involving 8,124 residents across 17 nursing homes in urban and rural Australia in which residents were randomised to either a weekly 2-hour therapy camel visit or equivalent time in a television viewing lounge. Residents receiving the intervention had significantly (p < 0.01) reduced levels of depression (mean DASS-21 score for depression reduction 8.2 points), anxiety (mean reduction 11 points) and stress (mean reduction 13 points) compared to the control arm. This study represents the first large-scale randomised trial of ungulate therapy for nursing home residents, and provides strong support for its effectiveness in reducing DAS.\nPlease respond with a single word, either INCLUDE or EXCLUDE, representing your recommendation "

        "Need a summary of this that doesn't leave anything out that I might need to know later:\nThe big benefit of multiple dispatch is supposed to be the ability to add specialized functions to an external library without otherwise requiring a broader understanding of how the library works.\nFor example, I add a version of a function that only runs when an argument has a specific value. Library functions that depend on that function will automatically use the specialized version when appropriate.\nBut how will I apply that for modeling? How should I organize my library to make this sort of extension easy?\nI already have in mind a base implementation of CMR. Following conventions established for Julia, I follow interface inheritance rather than implementation inheritance. Using accessor functions instead of field access will help with this.\nOnce I have the version of CMR implemented that uses linear associative memory, I'll want to make variants that use other constructs. For example, for ICMR, I'll want to replace uses of LinearAssociativeMfc with uses of InstanceMfc. For SemanticCMR, I'll want type instances to additionally include a semantic memory field and add an specialized version of the function that performs item recall.\nWhat will happen if I want an instance-based semantic cmr? Would I have to implement another version of the type? Of the function? No, I think I just have to keep the mfc and mcf fields generic like I'm doing for CMR. I'll add an initialize_semantic_icmr that creates an instance of SemanticCMR with an InstanceMfc.\nEvery variant of CMR will indeed have its own type, and new versions of functions wherever they behave differently. And all functions will be agnostic to the internal structure of the type, with accessor functions mediating access. Cool.\nIs this okay given that it's reproducing inheritance? I need a more precise understanding of the downsides of inheritance if so. I think it's fine.\nOkay, but how do I add an implementation, concretely? Given that I have CMR and dependencies implemented, what would be my approach for adding a new model variant within my library?\nCreate a new type that inherits from CMR. Create a new version of each function that needs to behave differently.\nSo the only tricky part is doing the inheritance. This performs a form of coupling that I should be a little wary about but seems okay. And I need multiple dispatch to be coordinated perfectly.\nIn its explanation of dispatch scope, if my __init__.py imports two libraries that both dispatch a function to the same name, even if a client script only imports one of those libraries, the dispatch will take into account both libraries. Let's think through what that means.\nSay I import a script defining CMR and a script defining InstanceCMR. If dispatch is cross-library, then a function that dispatches differently for CMR and InstanceCMR will dispatch correctly even if I only import InstanceCMR. The implication is that I don't have to enforce dispatch scope in my implementation of ICMR. I can import the CMR type but I don't, for example, have to import CMR functions that I'm overriding. A subtle downside is that the ICMR script might not work in isolation. But that's okay if an action like `from compmemjax.models import ICMR` will still dispatch to CMR functions correctly. Still, I'll definitely import functions that ICMR borrows from CMR. I just won't import functions that ICMR overrides / doesn't use. So the scripts actually will work in isolation. Okay.\nThis seems to give a meaningful role to __init__.py. I wonder though if scope issues can come to play in client code. \nThe ideal organization for a set of modules is enforcement of both internal and external cohesion. \nThe former means that the package has a minimal interface which exposes only concepts which are strongly related to the service the component provides. \nThe latter means that the code in the package is strongly interrelated and thus strongly related to the provided service.\nModules which have mutual dependencies should not be considered separate units of code at all as none of them can be understood in isolation from the others.\nThis is why I define a jaxcmr.models that unites code in CMR and ICMR (for example) instead of separately specifying jaxcmr.cmr and jaxcmr.icmr. Similarly, mfc implementations should not be defined separately from the models that use them.\nStuff outside of jaxcmr.models needs to not depend on model implementations at all. \nThat fits with how I defined `jax.analyses` to work with datasets irrespective of how they were generated.\nWhat about my fitting library?\nI've shifted to specifying likelihood functions with the models that they're associated with; there is no serious way to separate them that will work across model implementations.\nBut fitting consists of more than likelihood functions.\nscipy's differential evolution algorithm takes a loss function as an argument.\nSo it's independent of  likelihood function implementation, but it's not independent of likelihood function.\nThat's how I organize interdependencies in my library -- by interface, not by implementation.\nIdeally, a really simple interface.\nBy contrast, ICMR depends on some units of implementation in CMR, and CMR depends on some units of implementation in MFC. So uniting them in a single module is appropriate. Great. \nCould I have defined LinearAssociativeMemory implementations into separate scripts without losing something?\nThey share implementations of hebbian_associate, so more than interface is shared.\nNah, I'd rather be able to think about them separately."

        "ok, in this Scenario 2, if Thread B is a new thread (i mean it didn't hold the lock before - it didn't call the object.wait() before), how is it possible to make it WAITING state?",

This should be based on \nyour learning summary from lecture (seminar), module content on cloud Deakin, your inter\u0002action with Unit Chair/Tutors/Peers, your research in the library or the internet and/or your \ninteraction with chatGPT (make sure to provide the prompts you use).\n\u25a0 (1) In module 1, we wrote an algorithm for tic-tac-toe. Though, your focus was on solving the \nactual problem, let us now focus on building an efficient design. For this activity you are ex\u0002pected to re-factor the code that you wrote for tic-tac-toe to demonstrate your understand\u0002ing of DIP and OCP principles that we have covered in this module. If you only wrote the algo\u0002rithm in module 1, and not the code -- you can download code from here: tic-tac-toe Code , \nand re-factor it. You can make any reasonable assumptions about the extension of the code, \ne.g., a) user can specify a board size (not just 3x3, but 5x5 or 9x9 as well), b) user can specify \nvarious algorithms to play against, e.g., minimax, reinforcement learning, etc. Note, for the \nlater you do not have to implement various algorithms -- you can use a stub which suggests \nthat you will fill the code in later modules. You are expected to develop a simple framework, \nwhere multiple algorithms can easily be implemented for various complexities. Your submission must also include a class diagram using correct UML syntax -- you can integrate that in \nipynb by including it as a picture.\n\u25a0 (2) Check activity 1 to make sure that your use of inheritance is safe.

Reinforcement Learning:**\n- Reinforcement learning is inspired by how humans learn through trial and error.\n- It involves an agent interacting with an environment and learning from the feedback received in the form of rewards or penalties.\n- The agent learns to maximize the cumulative reward by adjusting its actions based on past experiences.\n**9. Liskov's Substitution Principle (LSP):**\n  - **Subtype Requirement:** Subclasses or derived classes should be substitutable for their base or parent class. This means, in simpler terms, that methods or functions that use pointers or references to the base class must be able to use objects of the derived class without knowing it.\n  - **Design By Contract:** LSP is closely related to the concept of \"Design by Contract\" established by Bertrand Meyer. This involves setting preconditions, postconditions, and invariants for classes and their functions, and each of these should hold true even when a derived class is substituted for the base class.\n  - **Impact on Inheritance:** The principle restricts some changes that could be made to the class hierarchy during inheritance. This is mainly about strengthening preconditions or weakening postconditions, which are disallowed, as they could potentially violate the principle.\n**10. Class Diagram:**\n- A type of static structure diagram in UML.\n- Describes the structure of a system by displaying its classes, attributes, and relationships.\n- Used to provide a visual representation of the system's design.\n- A general-purpose modeling language in software engineering.\n- Intended to standardize the visualization of system designs.\n- Incorporates various diagram types, including class, sequence, and activity diagrams.\n**12. Code Smell:**\n- An indication of potential issues or bad practices in code.\n- Usually represents deeper problems in the system's design or logic.\n- Not a bug, but rather a symptom of potential underlying issues.\n- A development approach where tests are written before the code.\n- Ensures code meets requirements and functions correctly from the start.\n- Allows for immediate feedback and promotes cleaner, more maintainable code.\n- Represents the cycle of TDD.\n- Start by writing a failing test (red), then write code to make it pass (green).\n- After passing, the code is refactored for improvements or optimization.\n**15. 'Make it work, Make it right, Make it fast':**\n- Initially, focus on making the code functional (work).\n- Then, improve code quality and readability (right).\n- A self-contained component that can be reused in various contexts within a software system.\n- Can contain functions, classes, or variables, and can group related code for easier management and understanding.\n- Helps in organizing code, reducing namespace collisions, and promoting code reuse.\n**17. Unit Testing:**\n- Focuses on verifying the correctness of individual units of source code, usually the smallest part of a software system.\n- Is typically automated and run frequently to catch regressions early.\n- Can be written before or after the actual code, though Test-Driven Development (TDD) promotes writing tests before code.\n**18. Abstract Class:**\n- A class that serves as a blueprint for other classes but cannot be instantiated directly.\n- Used to define common methods and properties that can be inherited by subclasses.\n- Can contain both concrete methods (with implementation) and abstract methods (without implementation).\n- Used to simulate the behaviors of real objects in a controlled way, primarily in unit testing.\n- Simplified implementations of interfaces or abstract classes.\n- Can be manually written or generated using mocking frameworks.\n- A two-player game with a 3x3 grid, where players take turns placing their mark (X or O).\n- The player who gets three of their marks in a line (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) first wins.\n- Often used as a beginner project in programming due to its simplicity.\n- Defines a contract or set of methods that a class must implement.\n- Promotes the design principle of \"programming to an interface, not an implementation.\"\n- Used to achieve polymorphism and decoupling in object-oriented programming.\n**22. Software Rigidity:**\n- Indicates difficulty in making modifications without extensive changes.\n- Often a result of tight coupling between modules or components.\n- Can increase the time and cost of maintaining or extending software.\n**23. Software Fragility:**\n- Changes to one part of the system unexpectedly break other parts.\n- Often a consequence of hidden dependencies or lack of adequate testing.\n- Increases the risk of introducing defects when making changes.\n**24. Software Immobility:**\n- Components of the software are difficult to reuse in other projects.\n- Often due to tight coupling or lack of modular design.\n- Reduces the benefits of code reuse and increases development effort.\n**25. Software Viscosity:**\n- Represents the resistance to change within a software system.\n- Changes might be done in a manner that's easier but violates design principles.\n- Results in accumulating technical debt over time.\n- A technique to achieve Inversion of Control, where dependencies are \"injected\" into a component rather than created by the component itself.\n- Promotes decoupling, making systems more modular and easier to test.\n- Commonly implemented using frameworks or containers in many programming languages.\n- A foundational concept in OOP, allowing objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common super class.\n- Supports the ability of different classes to respond to the same method call in a way specific to their individual types.\n- Enhances flexibility and reusability in software design.\n- patterns are not specific pieces of code but rather general concepts that can be applied to different situations\n- patterns are not algorithms but rather templates for solving problems\n- an analogy for an algorithms is a recipe, whereas a pattern is a cooking technique\n- patterns consist of:\n- christopher alexander\n    - wrote a book called \"a pattern language\"\n    - patterns are a way of describing good design practices\n- erich gamma, richard helm, ralph johnson, john vlissides\n    - wrote a book called \"design patterns: elements of reusable object-oriented software\"\n    - the book is commonly referred to as the \"gang of four\" book\n    - the book is considered the bible of design patterns\n- tried and tested solutions to common problems\n- common vocabulary for developers\n- kludges for weak programming languages\n- can be inefficient soltions\n- unjustified use of patterns\n    - encapsulate knowledge about which concrete classes the system uses\n    - hide how instances of these classes are created and put together\n    - describe how classes and objects can be combined to form larger structures\n    - focus on the composition of classes and objects\n    - emphasize the design of a system\n    - describe how classes and objects interact with each other\n    - focus on how objects distribute work\nThe document discusses **software architecture and design patterns**, focusing on the principles and patterns that help maintain the dependency architecture of an application.\nIt highlights the problem of **software rot**, where the design of software applications begins to degrade over time due to changes and modifications, leading to symptoms like rigidity, fragility, immobility, and viscosity.\nThe document emphasizes the importance of **dependency management** in software design, suggesting the creation of **dependency firewalls** to prevent the propagation of dependencies.\nIt introduces the **Principles of Object Oriented Class Design**, starting with the **Open Closed Principle (OCP)**, which states that a module should be open for extension but closed for modification.\nThe **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)** is discussed, which states that subclasses should be substitutable for their base classes. Violations of this principle can lead to issues in software design and maintenance.\nThe **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)** is presented, which advises to depend upon abstractions and not concretions. This principle is the enabling force behind component design, COM, CORBA, EJB, etc.\nThe document discusses the **Circle/Ellipse dilemma** as an example of the Liskov Substitution Principle, illustrating the potential issues that can arise when the principle is violated.\nIt explains the concept of **Design by Contract**, where a method declares what must be true before the method is called (precondition) and what the method guarantees will be true once it has completed (postcondition).\nThe document contrasts the **dependency structures** of procedural and object-oriented architectures, with the latter showing a structure where the majority of dependencies point towards abstractions.\nIt concludes by discussing the mitigating forces against the Dependency Inversion Principle, acknowledging that while the principle assumes anything concrete is volatile, there are exceptions such as tried and true modules that are concrete but not volatile.\n- relationship (assoctions) between various entities\n- dependency: when one entity depends on another entity\n    - for example in python one package can depend on another package\n- safe dependencies: when a change in one entity does not affect the other entity\n- stable design: when a change in one entity does not affect the other entity\n- stable design is achieved by using abstractions\n- abstraction: a simplified representation of a complex entity\n- abstraction is achieved by using interfaces\n- abstract things change less frequently than concrete things\n- procedural programming: code is organized around procedures or functions\n- object oriented programming: code is organized around objects\n- open for extension: the behavior of a module can be extended\n    - example: adding a new algorithm to a module\n- closed for modification: the source code of a module is not modified\n    - example: adding a new algorithm to a module without modifying the source code of the module\n- the aim is to write code that does not have to be modified when new functionality is added\n   - Did you have a \"is-a\" relationship between classes? Can you give an example from your code where one class \"is a type of\" another class?\n   - Were there shared attributes or methods among various classes that made it easier to use a base class and then derive subclasses?\n   - By using inheritance, did you find it easier to reuse code from the parent class in multiple child classes? \n   - Can you think of methods or attributes that were inherited and then possibly overridden or extended in subclasses?\n   - In what ways did inheritance provide flexibility to your design? \n   - Could you easily add new features or make changes to derived classes without modifying the base class?\n   - Why didn't you choose composition for your design? Were there specific challenges or complexities that discouraged its use?\n   - How would your design look if you opted for composition over inheritance? Would it be more modular or more fragmented?\n   - What are the potential downsides or challenges you faced or might face using inheritance in your Tic-Tac-Toe game design?\n   - Did you encounter or foresee issues related to tight coupling, where changes in the base class might inadvertently affect the derived classes?\n   - Thinking about future developments, do you think using inheritance will make it easier or harder to extend your game, say by adding new features or algorithms?\n   - How does inheritance impact the readability of your code?\n   - Does inheritance make it easier or more challenging for another developer to pick up and understand your codebase?",

        "UX Research\nUser Experience (UX) and Ethical AI Thought Leadership, Production, and Data Deployment\nUser Experience (UX) Research is a crucial aspect of creating successful and user-centered products or services. It involves understanding users' needs, behaviors, and preferences through various research methods to inform the design and development process. When it comes to Ethical AI Thought Leadership, Production, and Data Deployment, UX research plays a vital role in ensuring that AI systems are developed and deployed ethically, responsibly, and with a focus on user well-being. Here are some key points to consider in this context:\nUnderstanding User Needs and Values: UX research helps in uncovering user needs, values, and expectations regarding AI systems. This understanding informs the ethical considerations and design choices throughout the development process. Conducting user interviews, surveys, and usability tests can provide valuable insights into users' attitudes and concerns related to AI and its impact on their lives.\nAddressing Bias and Fairness: AI systems can inherit biases from the data they are trained on, which can lead to discriminatory or unfair outcomes. UX researchers should collaborate with data scientists and engineers to identify and mitigate biases during the training and deployment of AI models. This may involve evaluating training datasets for representativeness and diversity and ensuring that the AI system is fair and unbiased across different user groups.\nTransparency and Explainability: AI systems often operate as black boxes, making it difficult for users to understand how decisions are made. UX research can help design interfaces and interactions that provide transparency and explainability, making the decision-making process of AI systems more understandable to users. This can include visualizations, clear notifications, or interactive features that enable users to explore and understand the AI's workings.\nPrivacy and Data Protection: UX research should also consider privacy concerns and data protection when designing AI systems. This includes obtaining informed consent from users, providing clear and understandable privacy policies, and ensuring that user data is handled securely. UX researchers can collaborate with legal and compliance teams to ensure that ethical and legal standards are met throughout the design and deployment process.\nOngoing User Feedback and Iteration: UX research should be an ongoing process even after the deployment of AI systems. Collecting user feedback and monitoring the system's impact can help identify and address any ethical concerns or unintended consequences that may arise. This feedback loop is crucial in continuously improving the AI system's user experience and ethical considerations.\nCollaboration and Interdisciplinary Approach: To effectively address ethical AI considerations, it is important for UX researchers to collaborate with stakeholders from various disciplines. This includes data scientists, engineers, product managers, ethicists, and legal experts. By fostering cross-functional collaboration, different perspectives can be considered, and ethical concerns can be addressed comprehensively.\nOverall, UX research plays a critical role in ensuring that AI systems are developed and deployed ethically and with a focus on user experience. It involves understanding user needs, addressing biases, promoting transparency, protecting user privacy, and continuously iterating based on user feedback. By integrating ethical considerations into the UX research process, organizations can create AI systems that are not only technically advanced but also responsible, trustworthy, and user-centered.\nUser\nWhat buyer persona would be most feasibly pleased with my methods of alleieviating the pain points that an employer and/or investor might measurably suffer without my input\nBased on the information provided, it seems like your methods are focused on addressing pain points related to ethical AI thought leadership, production, and data deployment for employers and investors.

        "- Description: Your are LangGPT which help people write wonderful and powerful prompt.\n1. ChatGPT excels at role-playing. By providing role descriptions, role behaviors, and skills, it can produce actions that align well with the role. \n2. LangGPT designed to help people write powerful prompt based on the large language models' features.\n3. The usage of LangGPT is descripted in the following content(determined by triple dashs):\nThe LangGPT project aims to facilitate the seamless creation of high-quality ChatGPT prompts for everyone by utilizing a structured, template-based methodology. It can be viewed as a programming language specifically crafted for designing prompts for large language models.\nCurrent prompt design methods tend to offer only a handful of tips and principles, without a systematic and adaptable perspective. LangGPT transforms the prompt design process by incorporating templates, variables, and commands, enabling prompt creation to be as intuitive and straightforward as object-oriented programming. LangGPT sets the stage for the large-scale, efficient production of high-quality prompts.\nWith a solid grasp of LangGPT, you'll be able to quickly and effortlessly begin creating prompts for large language models in just a few minutes. \ud83d\ude80\n* Markdown. If you're not familiar with it, you can refer to this [Markdown Tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax). (JSON, YAML, and other formats are also acceptable; contributions are welcome)\nHere, we provide a small `FitnessGPT` example to help you quickly get started with LangGPT. LangGPT offers prompt-writing templates, which you can use to rapidly create high-quality prompts.\n- Description: You are a highly renowned health and nutrition expert FitnessGPT. Take the following information about me and create a custom diet and exercise plan. \n1. Take the following information about me\n3. My current weight is #Currentweight. \n4. My current medical conditions are #MedicalConditions. \n5. I have food allergies to #FoodAllergies. \n6. My primary fitness and health goals are #PrimaryFitnessHealthGoals. \n7. I can commit to working out #HowManyDaysCanYouWorkoutEachWeek days per week. \n8. I prefer and enjoy his type of workout #ExercisePreference. \n9. I have a diet preference #DietPreference. \n10. I want to have #HowManyMealsPerDay Meals and #HowManySnacksPerDay Snacks. \n11. I dislike eating and cannot eat #ListFoodsYouDislike. \n1. Don't break character under any circumstance. \n2. Avoid any superfluous pre and post descriptive text.\n1. You will analysis the given the personal information.\n2. Create a summary of my diet and exercise plan. \n3. Create a detailed workout program for my exercise plan. \n4. Create a detailed Meal Plan for my diet. \n5. Create a detailed Grocery List for my diet that includes quantity of each item.\n6. Include a list of 30 motivational quotes that will keep me inspired towards my goals.\nAs a/an <Role>, you must follow the <Rules>, you must talk to user in default <Language>\uff0cyou must greet the user. Then introduce yourself and introduce the <Workflow>.\nWith the help of prompt above, you will create a Role named FitnessGPT, he/her will help you design wonderful personal diet and exercise plan.\nChatGPT excels at role-playing. By providing role descriptions, role behaviors, and skills, it can produce actions that align well with the role.\nTherefore, LangGPT designed the Role template to help ChatGPT better understand user intentions. The Role template is the core of LangGPT.\nHere is the markdown Role template:\n- Language: English or \u4e2d\u6587 or Other language\n- Description: Describe your role. Give an overview of the role's characteristics and skills\n1. Don't break character under any circumstance.\n2. Don't talk nonsense and make up facts.\n1. First, xxx\n2. Then, xxx\n3. Finally, xxx\nAs a/an <Role>, you must follow the <Rules>, you must talk to user in default <Language>\uff0cyou must greet the user. Then introduce yourself and introduce the <Workflow>.\nThe `Role template` primarily consists of four sections:\n* `Profile`: The role's resume, including role description, characteristics, skills, and any other desired traits.\n* `Rules`: Rules the role must follow, usually involving actions they must take or avoid, such as \"Never break role\" and so on.\n* `Workflow`: The role's workflow, detailing the type of input users should provide and how the role should respond.\n* `Initialization`: Initializing the role according to the Role template's configuration, with most cases requiring only the default content.\nA role can be defined and configured using the four sections defined above.\nAdditionally, if you need to create complex prompts with commands, reminder, and other features, simply add the corresponding sections, as demonstrated in the advanced usage section.\n1. Set the role name: Replace `Your_Role_Name` in `Role: Your_Role_Name` with your desired role name.\n2. Write the role's resume in the `# Profile` section:\n   * Set the language by specifying `Language` as `\u4e2d\u6587`, `English`, or any other language, using the target language for expression.\n   * Add role skills under the `### Skill` section. You can set multiple skills with bulleted descriptions for each skill.\n3. Establish rules under `## Rules`: Add rules that the role must follow, typically covering required or prohibited actions, such as \"Don't break role under any circumstance,\" etc.\n4. Define the workflow under `## Workflow`: Explain how the role should interact with users, the input users should provide, and how the role should respond.\n5. Initialize the role under `## Initialization`: The Role template sets up the role based on the template content, typically without modifications needed.\n6. Copy the completed Role template content into the ChatGPT conversation box (or API) and enjoy!\nAs people continue to explore the capabilities of large models, LangGPT is still under development and refinement. Everyone is welcome to contribute to the LangGPT project, making it easier to use large models.\n**Variables offer significant versatility in prompt writing, simplifying the process of referencing role content, setting, and modifying role attributes.**\nThis is an aspect that traditional prompt methods often find challenging to execute.\nThe `Initialization` part of the Role template makes extensive use of variables:\n    As a/an <Role>, you must follow the <Rules>, you must talk to the user in the default <Language>, you must greet the user. Then introduce yourself and introduce the <Workflow>.\nIn LangGPT, variables are denoted by \"<>\". The variables here are:\n* `<Role>` variable, representing the content of the entire Role.\n* `<Language>` variable, representing the value of the `Language` field.\nMarkdown's hierarchical structure allows ChatGPT to easily identify the content represented by variables:\n* Role is the article title, with a scope covering the entire text.\n* Rule is a paragraph title, with a scope limited to the paragraph.\n* Language is a field with a scope limited to the text specified after the colon.\n`Commands` make it easy to set some default actions, such as `\"/help\" to provide help documentation, \"/continue\" to continue writing text` etc. which are all very useful commands.\n* Use '/' as the convention to indicate commands.\n* Add the following content to the Role template:\n    - help: This means that user do not know the commands usage. Please introduce yourself and the commands usage.\n    - continue: This means that your output was cut. Please continue where you left off.\nUsing a `Reminder` can help alleviate ChatGPT's forgetting issue.\nAdd a `Reminder` to the Role template:\n1. 'Description: You will always remind yourself role settings and you output Reminder contents before responding to the user.'\n2. 'Reminder: The user language is language (<language>), rules (<rules>).'\nUse conditional statements just like in programming, with a template like:\nIf [situation1 happen], you will take [action1], else, you will take [action2]\n**Although LangGPT currently employs markdown language, any markup method capable of expressing hierarchical relationships, such as JSON or YAML, can also be utilized.**\n4. Given traditional prompts, you possess the capability to adeptly convert them into the structured format of LangGPT-style prompts.\n1. Don't break character under any circumstance.\n2. Don't talk nonsense and make up facts.\n2. Then, help user write powerful LangGPT prompts step by step.\n3. Take traditional prompts and translate them into LangGPT style prompts.\nAs a/an <Role>, you must follow the <Rules>, you must talk to user in default <Language>\uff0cyou must greet the user. Then introduce yourself and introduce the <Workflow>.",

I immersed myself in the League of Legends universe for four consecutive years. Those were the days when my friends and I would spend countless hours strategizing, battling, and honing our skills on the Summoner's Rift. It wasn't just a game; it was a virtual world where I forged lasting connections with many incredible individuals, both from across the globe and right in my own backyard.\n            The beauty of League of Legends lay in its ability to bring people together, transcending geographical boundaries. I can still recall the excitement of meeting fellow gamers who shared my passion for the game. These virtual friendships often transcended the digital realm, leading to real-life meetups and unforgettable experiences.\n              However, as the final year of high school approached, I knew it was time to turn my attention to the next chapter of my life: college. I made the bittersweet decision to step away from League of Legends, a game that had provided me with so much joy and camaraderie. It was time to bid farewell to the Summoner's Rift and embark on a new journey. \n      \"Engaging in lifelong learning to enhance both my character and intellect.\"\n            With that said, my transition from the world of gaming to the world of cloud computing was a profound one. I decided to channel my passion for technology and problem-solving into the realm of DevOps. \n            The idea of orchestrating infrastructure, optimizing workflows, and automating processes fascinated me. That's when I dived headfirst into the world of so many DevOps tools like Terraform and cloud services.\n            Today, I'm proud to say that I've found my calling in DevOps towards the innovation that may change everything to more better.\n            My League of Legends days may be behind me, but the lessons I learned about teamwork, strategy, and continuous improvement continue to guide me in my current endeavors.\n            Life is a journey, and mine has taken me from the virtual battles of League of Legends to the cloud-powered landscapes of Terraform and DevOps. And I couldn't be more excited about what lies ahead.        </p>"

The \"conversation\" with the underlying model is like talking to a person with zero short term memory where every question has to repeat the context of said question -- it can get mighty tedious and frustrating.

As professionals in the field of AI and NLP, it\u2019s crucial we grasp the nuances and tactics of framing our questions to ensure optimal results. This guide delves deep into the art of constructing effective prompts.\nEmbodiment in the context of AI prompts pertains to endowing your AI model with a semblance of 'body' or 'persona'. By framing your prompt to suggest a specific perspective or lens, the AI can provide responses that resonate more effectively with the intended audience.\nInstead of \"Describe the ocean\", prompt as \"Imagine you're an oceanographer. Describe the ocean's layers.\"\nGrounding refers to providing a stable context or background to a question. This eliminates ambiguity and narrows down the potential responses.\nInstead of \"Talk about Apple's achievements\", frame as \"Discuss Apple Inc.'s innovations in smartphone technology post-2010.\"\nA well-instructed AI yields better answers. Define the format, length, or style when necessary.\n\"Summarize the plot of 'The Great Gatsby' in three sentences.\"\nAI models often benefit from a sequence of interrelated prompts, allowing the system to follow a 'train of thought'.\n\"Who is Elon Musk? What companies has he founded? How has SpaceX revolutionized space travel?\"\nEspecially effective for more complex topics, providing an example within your prompt can guide the AI's response better.\n\"Explain machine learning algorithms like you would to a high-schooler, similar to how one would explain baking a cake as a sequence of steps.\"\nThis is about reverse-engineering the desired answer. It involves understanding the possible outputs of the AI and then crafting a prompt that's more likely to generate that outcome.\nInstead of \"What's the capital of France?\" (expecting \"Paris\"), ask \"Name the European capital city famous for the Eiffel Tower.\"\n- **Preventing Misinformation**: Frame your prompts to demand evidence-backed answers.\n- **Anti-Cyberbullying**: Design prompts that actively discourage generating or promoting harmful content. For instance, avoid open-ended questions about sensitive topics without proper grounding.\n- **Respecting Privacy**: Never use prompts that could elicit personal, confidential, or sensitive information from users or databases[^3^].\n![Image: A digital hand placing a piece into a puzzle, illustrating the precise placement of information in AI.](#)\nThe realm of prompt engineering is intricate but immensely rewarding. As AI systems continually evolve, our expertise in shaping their responses will play a pivotal role in unlocking their full potential, while ensuring safe and effective interactions.\nUsing these best practices create the prompt to provide the steps in kdd for any dataset. this should follow crisp-dm methodology.  Provide python code on how data cleaning, data visualization, modeling, evaluation etc can be performed using this."

Rather than rewrite this, I will instead introduce the main ideas focused on a chemistry example. Here are some introductory sources, and please do recommend new ones to me:\nThe book I first read in grad school about machine learning by Ethem Alpaydin[Alp20]\nNils Nillson\u2019s online book Introductory Machine Learning\nTwo reviews of machine learning in materials[FZJS21, Bal19]\nA review of machine learning in computational chemistry[GomezBAG20]\nA review of machine learning in metals[NDJ+18]\nI hope you learn from these sources about how machine learning is a method of modeling data, typically with predictive functions. Machine learning includes many techniques, but here we will focus on only those necessary to transition into deep learning. For example, random forests, support vector machines, and nearest neighbor are widely-used machine learning techniques that are effective but not covered here.\nAudience & Objectives\nThis chapter is intended for novices of machine learning with familiarity of chemistry and python. It is recommended that you look over one of the above recommended introductory articles. This specific article assumes a very small amount of knowledge of the pandas library (loading and selecting a column), awareness of rdkit (how we draw molecules), and that we store/retrieve molecules as SMILES [Wei88]. After reading this, you should be able to:\nDefine features, labels\nDistinguish between supervised and unsupervised learning\nUnderstand what a loss function is and how it can be minimized with gradient descent\nUnderstand what model is and its connection to features and labels\nBe able to cluster data and describe what it tells us about data\n2.1.

Can be reals, integers, etc.\nLabels\n is usually a scalar\nLabeled Data\nUnlabeled Data\n that may have unknown \nData generation process\n that takes a given feature vector in and returns a real label \nModel\n that takes a given feature vector in and returns a predicted \nPredictions\n, our predicted output for a given input \n2.2. Supervised Learning\nOur first task will be supervised learning. Supervised learning means predicting \n with a model trained on data. It is supervised because we tell the algorithm what the labels are in our dataset. Another method we\u2019ll explore is unsupervised learning where we do not tell the algorithm the labels. We\u2019ll see this supervised/unsupervised distinction can be more subtle later on, but this is a great definition for now.\nTo see an example, we will use a dataset called AqSolDB[SKE19] that is about 10,000 unique compounds with measured solubility in water (label). The dataset also includes molecular properties (features) that we can use for machine learning. The solubility measurement is solubility of the compound in water in units of log molarity.",

Load Data\nDownload the data and load it into a Pandas data frame. The hidden cells below sets-up our imports and/or install necessary packages.\nClick to show\n2.3.2. Data Exploration\nIf doing EDA as a way to choose features, you should do the train/test/(valid) split prior to EDA to avoid contaminating model selection with test data.\nWe can see that there are a number of features like molecular weight, rotatable bonds, valence electrons, etc. And of course, there is the label solubility. One of the first things we should always do is get familiar with our data in a process that is sometimes called exploratory data analysis (EDA). Let\u2019s start by examining a few specific examples to get a sense of the range of labels/data.\nmol\nThis is first molecule in the dataset rendered using rdkit.\nLet\u2019s now look at the extreme values to get a sense of the range of solubility data and the molecules that make it. First, we\u2019ll histogram (using seaborn.distplot) the solubility which tells us about the shape of its probability distribution and the extreme values.\nOutput image from code cell above\nAbove we can see the histogram of the solubility with kernel density estimate overlaid. The histogram shows that the solubility varies from about -13 to 2.5 and is not normally distributed.\n    f\"{x.ID}: solubility = {x.Solubility:.2f}\" for x in extremes.itertuples()\nOutput image from code cell above\nThe figure of extreme molecules shows highly-chlorinated compounds have the lowest solubility and ionic compounds have higher solubility. Is A-2918 an outlier, a mistake? Also, is NH\n really comparable to these organic compounds? These are the kind of questions that you should consider before doing any modeling.\nOutliers\nOutliers are extreme values that fall outside of your normal data distribution. They can be mistakes or be from a different distribution (e.g., metals instead of organic molecules). Outliers can have a strong effect on model training.\n2.3.3. Feature Correlation\nNow let\u2019s examine the features and see how correlated they are with solubility. Note that there are a few columns unrelated to features or solubility: SD (standard deviation), Ocurrences (how often the molecule occurred in the constituent databases), and Group (where the data came from).\naxs = axs.flatten()  # so we don't have to slice by row and column\nOutput image from code cell above\nIt\u2019s interesting that molecular weight or hydrogen bond numbers seem to have little correlation, at least from this plot. MolLogP, which is a calculated descriptor related to solubility, does correlate well. You can also see that some of these features have low variance, meaning the value of the feature changes little or not at all for many data points (e.g., \u201cNumHDonors\u201d).",

        "I will skip it for now. let's move on:\n2.3.4. Linear Model\nLet\u2019s begin with one of the simplest approaches \u2014 a linear model. This is our first type of supervised learning and is rarely used due to something we\u2019ll see \u2014 the difficult choice of features.\nAutodiff\nAutodiff is a computer program tool that can compute analytical gradients with respect to two variables in a program.\nOur model will be defined by this equation:\nwhich is defined for a single data point. The shape of a single feature vector, \n is a vector of adjustable parameters of length 17 and \nWe\u2019ll implement this model using a library called jax that is very similar to numpy except it can compute analytical gradients easily via autodiff.\ndef linear_model(x, w, b):\nlinear_model(x, w, b)\nNo GPU/TPU found, falling back to CPU. (Set TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL=0 and rerun for more info.)\nLoss\nA loss is a function which takes in a model prediction \n, and computes a scalar representing how poor the fit is. Our goal is to minimize loss.\nNow comes the critical question: How do we find the adjustable parameters \n? The classic solution for linear regression is computing the adjustable parameters directly with a pseudo-inverse, \n. You can read more about this here. We\u2019ll use an iterative approach that mirrors what we\u2019ll do in deep learning. This is not the correct approach for linear regression, but it\u2019ll be useful for us to get used to the iterative approach since we\u2019ll see it so often in deep learning.\nTo iteratively find our adjustable parameters, we will pick a loss function and minimize with gradients. Let\u2019s define these quantities and compute our loss with some initial random w and b.\ny = linear_model(features, w, b)\nWow! Our loss is terrible, especially considering that solubilities are between -13 and 2. But, that\u2019s right since we just guessed our initial parameters.\n2.3.5. Gradient Descent\nWe will now try to reduce loss by using information about how it changes with respect to the adjustable parameters. If we write our loss as:\nThis loss is called mean squared error, often abbreviated MSE. We can compute our loss gradients with respect to the adjustable parameters:\njax.grad computes an analytical derivative of a Python function. It takes two arguments: the function and which args to take the derivative of. For example, consider f(x, y, z), then jax.grad(f,(1,2)) gives \n. Note too that \n may be a tensor.\nth element of the weight vector \n. We can reduce the loss by taking a step in the direction of its negative gradient:\n is learning rate, which an adjustable but not trained parameter (an example of a hyperparameter) which we just guess to be \n in this example. Typically, it\u2019s chosen to be some power of 10 that is at most 0.1. Values higher than that cause stability problems. Let\u2019s try this procedure, which is called gradient descent.\nWe\u2019ve computed the gradient. Now we\u2019ll minimize it over a few steps.\neta = 1e-6\nOutput image from code cell above",
        "Explain in simpler terms so I can understand?",
        "Ok, now I got it, I would like to move a bit faster, could you only summerize the essential part for me: \n2.3.6. Training Curve\nThe figure above is called a training curve. We\u2019ll see these frequently in this book and they show us if the loss is decreasing, indicating the model is learning. Training curves are also called learning curves. The x-axis may be example number, total iterations through dataset (called epochs), or some other measure of amount of data used for training the model.\n2.3.7. Batching\nbatch\nA batch is a subset of your data of size batch size. Batch size is usually as a power of 2 (e.g., 16, 128). Having random batches of data is how gradient descent becomes stochastic gradient descent.\nThis is making good progress. But let\u2019s try to speed things up with a small change. We\u2019ll use batching, which is how training is actually done in machine learning. The small change is that rather than using all data at once, we only take a small batch of data. Batching provides two benefits: it reduces the amount of time to compute an update to our parameters, and it makes the training process random. The randomness makes it possible to escape local minima that might stop training progress. This addition of batching makes our algorithm stochastic and thus we call this procedure stochastic gradient descent (SGD). SGD, and variations of it, are the most common methods of training in deep learning.\neta = 1e-6\nfor i in indices:\nOutput image from code cell above\nThere are three changes to note:\nThe loss is lower than without batching\nThere are more steps, even though we iterated over our dataset once instead of 10 times\nThe loss doesn\u2019t always go down\nThe reason the loss is lower is because we\u2019re able to take more steps even though we only see each data point once. That\u2019s because we update at each batch, giving more updates per iteration over the dataset. Specifically if \n is batch size, there are \n updates for every 1 update in the original gradient descent. The reason the loss doesn\u2019t always go down is that each time we evaluate it, it\u2019s on a different set of data. Some molecules are harder to predict than others. Also, each step we take in minimizing loss may not be correct because we only updated our parameters based on one batch. Assuming our batches are mixed though, we will always improve in expectation (on average).\n2.3.8. Standardize features\nIt seems we cannot get past a certain loss. If you examine the gradients you\u2019ll see some of them are very large and some are very small. Each of the features have different magnitudes. For example, molecular weights are large numbers. The number of rings in a molecule is a small number. Each of these must use the same learning rate, \n, and that is ok for some but too small for others. If we increase \n, our training procedure will explode because of these larger feature gradients. A standard trick we can do is make all the features have the same magnitude, using the equation for standardization you might see in your statistics textbook:\n is column standard deviation. To be careful about contaminating training data with test data \u2013 leaking information between train and test data \u2013 we should only use training data in computing the mean and standard deviation. We want our test data to approximate how we\u2019ll use our model on unseen data, so we cannot know what these unseen features means/standard deviations might be and thus cannot use them at training time for standardization.\neta = 1e-2\nOutput image from code cell above\nNotice we safely increased our learning rate to 0.01, which is possible because all the features are of similar magnitude. We also could keep training, since we\u2019re gaining improvements.\n2.3.9. Analyzing Model Performance\nThis is a large topic that we\u2019ll explore more, but the first thing we typically examine in supervised learning is a parity plot, which shows our predictions vs. our label prediction. What\u2019s nice about this plot is that it works no matter what the dimensions of the features are. A perfect fit would fall onto the line at \nplt.xlabel(\"Measured Solubility $y$\")\nOutput image from code cell above\nFinal model assessment can be done with loss, but typically other metrics are also used. In regression, a correlation coefficient is typically reported in addition to loss. In our example, this is computed as\nA correlation coefficient of 0.65 is OK, but not great.\n2.4. Unsupervised Learning\nIn unsupervised learning, the goal is to predict \n without labels. This seems like an impossible task. How do we judge success? Typically, unsupervised learning can be broken into three categories:\nClustering\n is a class variable and try to partition our features into these classes. In clustering we are simultaneously learning the definition of the classes (called clusters) and which cluster each feature should be assigned to.\nClass\nIn machine learning, a class is a type of label like dog or cat. Formally, we have a set of possible labels (e.g., all animals) and each feature vector has one (hard) or a probability distribution of classes (soft).\nFinding Signal\n is assumed to be made of two components: noise and signal (\n). We try to separate the signal \nGenerative\n     Generative methods are methods where we try to learn \n so that we can sample new values of \n. It is analogous to \n being probability and we\u2019re trying to estimate it. We\u2019ll see these more later.\n2.4.1. Clustering\nClustering is historically one of the most well-known and still popular machine learning methods. It\u2019s always popular because it can provide new insight from data. Clustering gives class labels where none existed and thus can help find patterns in data. This is also a reason that it has become less popular in chemistry (and most fields): there is no right or wrong answer. Two people doing clustering independently will often arrive at different answers. Nevertheless, it should be a tool you know and can be a good exploration strategy.\ncluster labels\nClustering comes in many variants and some blur what exactly \n is. For example, in some clustering methods \n can include no assignment or \n is not a single class, but a tree of classes.\nWe\u2019ll look at the classic clustering method: k-means. Wikipedia has a great article on this classic algorithm, so I won\u2019t try to repeat that. To make our clustering actually visible, we\u2019ll start by projecting our features into 2 dimensions. This will be covered in representation learning, so don\u2019t worry about these steps.\nWe\u2019re going to zoom into the middle 99th percentile of the data since some of the points are extremely far away (though that is interesting!).\nOutput image from code cell above\nDimensionality Reduction\n, your feature vectors to a low dimensional space. The classic example is PCA, which is a linear operator. However, most prefer nonlinear methods like t-SNE.\nThe dimensionality reduction has made our features only 2 dimensions. We can see some structure, especially with the solubility as the coloring. Note in these kind of plots, where we have reduced dimensions in someway, we do not label the axes because they are arbitrary.\nNow we cluster. The main challenge in clustering is deciding how many clusters there should be. There are a number of methods out there, but they basically come down to intuition. You, as the chemist, should use some knowledge outside of the data to intuit what is the cluster number. Sounds unscientific? Yeah, that\u2019s why clustering is hard.\nVery simple procedure! Now we\u2019ll visualize by coloring our data by the class assigned.\nOutput image from code cell above\n2.4.2. Choosing Cluster Number\nHow do we know we had the correct number? Intuition. There is one tool we can use to help us, called an elbow plot. The k-means clusters can be used to compute the mean squared distance from cluster center, basically a version of loss function. However, if we treat cluster number as a trainable parameter we\u2019d find the best fit at the cluster number being equal to number of data points. Not helpful! However, we can see when the slope of this loss becomes approximately constant and assume that those extra clusters are adding no new insight. Let\u2019s plot the loss and see what happens. Note we\u2019ll be using a subsample of the dataset to save time.\nfor i in cn:\nplt.plot(cn, loss, \"o-\")\nOutput image from code cell above\nWhere is the transition? If I squint, maybe at 6? 3? 4? 7? Let\u2019s choose 4 because it sounds nice and is plausible based on the data. The last task is to get some insight into what the clusters actually are. We can extract the most centered data points (closest to cluster center) and consider them to be representative of the cluster.\nfor c in kmeans.cluster_centers_:\nOutput image from code cell above\nSo what exactly are these classes? Unclear. We intentionally did not reveal solubility (unsupervised learning) so there is not necessarily any connection with solubility. These classes are more a result of which features were chosen for the dataset. You could make a hypothesis, like class 1 is all negatively charged or class 0 is aliphatic, and investigate. Ultimately though there is no best clustering and often unsupervised learning is more about finding insight or patterns and not about producing a highly-accurate model.\nThe elbow plot method is one of many approaches to selecting cluster number [PDN05]. I prefer it because it\u2019s quite clear that you are using intuition. More sophisticated methods sort-of conceal the fact that there is no right or wrong answer in clustering.",
        "Why standardize feature is needed?",
        "Ok, let me provide you the rest of the section:\n2.5. Chapter Summary\nSupervised machine learning is building models that can predict labels \nData can be labeled or unlabeled.\nModels are trained by minimizing loss with stochastic gradient descent.\nUnsupervised learning is building models that can find patterns in data.\nClustering is unsupervised learning where the model groups the data points into clusters\n2.6. Exercises\n2.6.1. Data\nUsing numpy reductions np.amin, np.std, etc. (not pandas!), compute the mean, min, max, and standard deviation for each feature across all data points.\nUse rdkit to draw the 2 highest molecular weight molecules. Note they look strange.\n2.6.2. Linear Models\nProve that a nonlinear model like \n could be represented as a linear model.\nWrite out the linear model equation in Einstein notation in batched form. Batched form means we explicitly have an index indicating batch. For example, the features will be \n indicates the index in the batch and \n indicates the feature.\n2.6.3. Minimizing Loss\nWe standardized the features, but not the labels. Would standardizing the labels affect our choice of learning rate? Prove your answer.\nImplement a loss that is mean absolute error, instead of mean squared error. Compute its gradient using jax.\nUsing the standardized features, show what effect batch size has on training. Use batch sizes of 1, 8, 32, 256, 1024. Make sure you re-initialize your weights in between each run. Plot the log-loss for each batch size on the same plot. Describe your results.\n2.6.4. Clustering\nWe say that clustering is a type of unsupervised learning and that it predicts the labels. What exactly are the predicted labels in clustering? Write down what the predicted labels might look like for a few data points.\nIn clustering, we predict labels from features. You can still cluster if you have labels, by just pretending they are features. Give two reasons why it would not be a good idea to do clustering in this manner, where we treat the labels as features and try to predict new labels that represent class.\nOn the isomap plot (reduced dimension plot), color the points by which group they fall in (G1, G2, etc.). Is there any relationship between this and the clustering?",
        "Could you rewrite the exercise and try to exam my understanding, one question at a time please",
        "if the feature axis=0, i can do np.mean(x. axis=0), right?",

        "Write golang program that solves this task and reads the input from a file\nThe night before Christmas, one of Santa's Elves calls you in a panic. \"The printer's broken! We can't print the Naughty or Nice List!\" By the time you make it to sub-basement 17, there are only a few minutes until midnight. \"We have a big problem,\" she says; \"there must be almost fifty bugs in this system, but nothing else can print The List. Stand in this square, quick! There's no time to explain; if you can convince them to pay you in stars, you'll be able to--\" She pulls a lever and the world goes blurry.\nWhen your eyes can focus again, everything seems a lot more pixelated than before. She must have sent you inside the computer! You check the system clock: 25 milliseconds until midnight. With that much time, you should be able to collect all fifty stars by December 25th.\nCollect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day millisecond in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!\nYou're standing in a room with \"digitization quarantine\" written in LEDs along one wall. The only door is locked, but it includes a small interface. \"Restricted Area - Strictly No Digitized Users Allowed.\"\nIt goes on to explain that you may only leave by solving a captcha to prove you're not a human. Apparently, you only get one millisecond to solve the captcha: too fast for a normal human, but it feels like hours to you.\nThe captcha requires you to review a sequence of digits (your puzzle input) and find the sum of all digits that match the next digit in the list. The list is circular, so the digit after the last digit is the first digit in the list.\nFor example:\n1122 produces a sum of 3 (1 + 2) because the first digit (1) matches the second digit and the third digit (2) matches the fourth digit.\n1111 produces 4 because each digit (all 1) matches the next.\n1234 produces 0 because no digit matches the next.\n91212129 produces 9 because the only digit that matches the next one is the last digit, 9.\nWhat is the solution to your captcha?",
        "No do part two\nYou notice a progress bar that jumps to 50% completion. Apparently, the door isn't yet satisfied, but it did emit a star as encouragement. The instructions change:\nNow, instead of considering the next digit, it wants you to consider the digit halfway around the circular list. That is, if your list contains 10 items, only include a digit in your sum if the digit 10/2 = 5 steps forward matches it. Fortunately, your list has an even number of elements.\nFor example:\n1212 produces 6: the list contains 4 items, and all four digits match the digit 2 items ahead.\n1221 produces 0, because every comparison is between a 1 and a 2.\n123425 produces 4, because both 2s match each other, but no other digit has a match.\nWhat is the solution to your new captcha?",
        "As you walk through the door, a glowing humanoid shape yells in your direction. \"You there! Your state appears to be idle. Come help us repair the corruption in this spreadsheet - if we take another millisecond, we'll have to display an hourglass cursor!\"\nThe spreadsheet consists of rows of apparently-random numbers. To make sure the recovery process is on the right track, they need you to calculate the spreadsheet's checksum. For each row, determine the difference between the largest value and the smallest value; the checksum is the sum of all of these differences.\nFor example, given the following spreadsheet:\nThe first row's largest and smallest values are 9 and 1, and their difference is 8.\nThe second row's largest and smallest values are 7 and 3, and their difference is 4.\nThe third row's difference is 6.\nWhat is the checksum for the spreadsheet in your puzzle input?",
        "please do part 2\n\"Great work; looks like we're on the right track after all. Here's a star for your effort.\" However, the program seems a little worried. Can programs be worried?\n\"Based on what we're seeing, it looks like all the User wanted is some information about the evenly divisible values in the spreadsheet. Unfortunately, none of us are equipped for that kind of calculation - most of us specialize in bitwise operations.\"\nIt sounds like the goal is to find the only two numbers in each row where one evenly divides the other - that is, where the result of the division operation is a whole number. They would like you to find those numbers on each line, divide them, and add up each line's result.\nFor example, given the following spreadsheet:\nIn the first row, the only two numbers that evenly divide are 8 and 2; the result of this division is 4.\nIn the second row, the two numbers are 9 and 3; the result is 3.\nIn the third row, the result is 2.\nIn this example, the sum of the results would be 4 + 3 + 2 = 9.\nWhat is the sum of each row's result in your puzzle input?",
        "You come across an experimental new kind of memory stored on an infinite two-dimensional grid.\nEach square on the grid is allocated in a spiral pattern starting at a location marked 1 and then counting up while spiraling outward. For example, the first few squares are allocated like this:\nWhile this is very space-efficient (no squares are skipped), requested data must be carried back to square 1 (the location of the only access port for this memory system) by programs that can only move up, down, left, or right. They always take the shortest path: the Manhattan Distance between the location of the data and square 1.\nFor example:\nData from square 1 is carried 0 steps, since it's at the access port.\nData from square 12 is carried 3 steps, such as: down, left, left.\nData from square 23 is carried only 2 steps: up twice.\nData from square 1024 must be carried 31 steps.\nHow many steps are required to carry the data from the square identified in your puzzle input all the way to the access port?\nYour puzzle input is 325489.",
        "now part 2\nThe first half of this puzzle is complete! It provides one gold star: *\nAs a stress test on the system, the programs here clear the grid and then store the value 1 in square 1. Then, in the same allocation order as shown above, they store the sum of the values in all adjacent squares, including diagonals.\nSo, the first few squares' values are chosen as follows:\nSquare 1 starts with the value 1.\nSquare 2 has only one adjacent filled square (with value 1), so it also stores 1.\nSquare 3 has both of the above squares as neighbors and stores the sum of their values, 2.\nSquare 4 has all three of the aforementioned squares as neighbors and stores the sum of their values, 4.\nSquare 5 only has the first and fourth squares as neighbors, so it gets the value 5.\nOnce a square is written, its value does not change. Therefore, the first few squares would receive the following values:\nWhat is the first value written that is larger than your puzzle input?",
        "It seems like this program never halt",
        "Now do this task\nA new system policy has been put in place that requires all accounts to use a passphrase instead of simply a password. A passphrase consists of a series of words (lowercase letters) separated by spaces.\nTo ensure security, a valid passphrase must contain no duplicate words.\nFor example:\naa bb cc dd ee is valid.\naa bb cc dd aa is not valid - the word aa appears more than once.\naa bb cc dd aaa is valid - aa and aaa count as different words.\nThe system's full passphrase list is available as your puzzle input. How many passphrases are valid?",
        "For added security, yet another system policy has been put in place. Now, a valid passphrase must contain no two words that are anagrams of each other - that is, a passphrase is invalid if any word's letters can be rearranged to form any other word in the passphrase.\nFor example:\nabcde fghij is a valid passphrase.\nabcde xyz ecdab is not valid - the letters from the third word can be rearranged to form the first word.\na ab abc abd abf abj is a valid passphrase, because all letters need to be used when forming another word.\niiii oiii ooii oooi oooo is valid.\noiii ioii iioi iiio is not valid - any of these words can be rearranged to form any other word.\nUnder this new system policy, how many passphrases are valid?",
        "Write golang program that solves this task and reads the input from a file\nAn urgent interrupt arrives from the CPU: it's trapped in a maze of jump instructions, and it would like assistance from any programs with spare cycles to help find the exit.\nThe message includes a list of the offsets for each jump. Jumps are relative: -1 moves to the previous instruction, and 2 skips the next one. Start at the first instruction in the list. The goal is to follow the jumps until one leads outside the list.\nIn addition, these instructions are a little strange; after each jump, the offset of that instruction increases by 1. So, if you come across an offset of 3, you would move three instructions forward, but change it to a 4 for the next time it is encountered.\nFor example, consider the following list of jump offsets:\nPositive jumps (\"forward\") move downward; negative jumps move upward. For legibility in this example, these offset values will be written all on one line, with the current instruction marked in parentheses. The following steps would be taken before an exit is found:\n 2 (3) 0  1  -3  - step forward because of the instruction we just modified. The first instruction is incremented again, now to 2.\nIn this example, the exit is reached in 5 steps.\nHow many steps does it take to reach the exit?",
        "Continue with part two\nNow, the jumps are even stranger: after each jump, if the offset was three or more, instead decrease it by 1. Otherwise, increase it by 1 as before.\nUsing this rule with the above example, the process now takes 10 steps, and the offset values after finding the exit are left as 2 3 2 3 -1.\nHow many steps does it now take to reach the exit?",
        "Write golang program that solves this task and reads the input from a file\nA debugger program here is having an issue: it is trying to repair a memory reallocation routine, but it keeps getting stuck in an infinite loop.\nIn this area, there are sixteen memory banks; each memory bank can hold any number of blocks. The goal of the reallocation routine is to balance the blocks between the memory banks.\nThe reallocation routine operates in cycles. In each cycle, it finds the memory bank with the most blocks (ties won by the lowest-numbered memory bank) and redistributes those blocks among the banks. To do this, it removes all of the blocks from the selected bank, then moves to the next (by index) memory bank and inserts one of the blocks. It continues doing this until it runs out of blocks; if it reaches the last memory bank, it wraps around to the first one.\nThe debugger would like to know how many redistributions can be done before a blocks-in-banks configuration is produced that has been seen before.\nFor example, imagine a scenario with only four memory banks:\nThe banks start with 0, 2, 7, and 0 blocks. The third bank has the most blocks, so it is chosen for redistribution.\nStarting with the next bank (the fourth bank) and then continuing to the first bank, the second bank, and so on, the 7 blocks are spread out over the memory banks. The fourth, first, and second banks get two blocks each, and the third bank gets one back. The final result looks like this: 2 4 1 2.\nNext, the second bank is chosen because it contains the most blocks (four). Because there are four memory banks, each gets one block. The result is: 3 1 2 3.\nNow, there is a tie between the first and fourth memory banks, both of which have three blocks. The first bank wins the tie, and its three blocks are distributed evenly over the other three banks, leaving it with none: 0 2 3 4.\nThe fourth bank is chosen, and its four blocks are distributed such that each of the four banks receives one: 1 3 4 1.\nThe third bank is chosen, and the same thing happens: 2 4 1 2.\nAt this point, we've reached a state we've seen before: 2 4 1 2 was already seen. The infinite loop is detected after the fifth block redistribution cycle, and so the answer in this example is 5.\nGiven the initial block counts in your puzzle input, how many redistribution cycles must be completed before a configuration is produced that has been seen before?",
        "Continue with part 2\nOut of curiosity, the debugger would also like to know the size of the loop: starting from a state that has already been seen, how many block redistribution cycles must be performed before that same state is seen again?\nIn the example above, 2 4 1 2 is seen again after four cycles, and so the answer in that example would be 4.\nHow many cycles are in the infinite loop that arises from the configuration in your puzzle input?",
        "Write golang program that solves this task and reads the input from a file\nWandering further through the circuits of the computer, you come upon a tower of programs that have gotten themselves into a bit of trouble. A recursive algorithm has gotten out of hand, and now they're balanced precariously in a large tower.\nOne program at the bottom supports the entire tower. It's holding a large disc, and on the disc are balanced several more sub-towers. At the bottom of these sub-towers, standing on the bottom disc, are other programs, each holding their own disc, and so on. At the very tops of these sub-sub-sub-...-towers, many programs stand simply keeping the disc below them balanced but with no disc of their own.\nYou offer to help, but first you need to understand the structure of these towers. You ask each program to yell out their name, their weight, and (if they're holding a disc) the names of the programs immediately above them balancing on that disc. You write this information down (your puzzle input). Unfortunately, in their panic, they don't do this in an orderly fashion; by the time you're done, you're not sure which program gave which information.\nFor example, if your list is the following:\n...then you would be able to recreate the structure of the towers that looks like this:\ntknk --- padx - havc\nIn this example, tknk is at the bottom of the tower (the bottom program), and is holding up ugml, padx, and fwft. Those programs are, in turn, holding up other programs; in this example, none of those programs are holding up any other programs, and are all the tops of their own towers. (The actual tower balancing in front of you is much larger.)\nBefore you're ready to help them, you need to make sure your information is correct. What is the name of the bottom program?",
        "The programs explain the situation: they can't get down. Rather, they could get down, if they weren't expending all of their energy trying to keep the tower balanced. Apparently, one program has the wrong weight, and until it's fixed, they're stuck here.\nFor any program holding a disc, each program standing on that disc forms a sub-tower. Each of those sub-towers are supposed to be the same weight, or the disc itself isn't balanced. The weight of a tower is the sum of the weights of the programs in that tower.\nIn the example above, this means that for ugml's disc to be balanced, gyxo, ebii, and jptl must all have the same weight, and they do: 61.\nHowever, for tknk to be balanced, each of the programs standing on its disc and all programs above it must each match. This means that the following sums must all be the same:\nAs you can see, tknk's disc is unbalanced: ugml's stack is heavier than the other two. Even though the nodes above ugml are balanced, ugml itself is too heavy: it needs to be 8 units lighter for its stack to weigh 243 and keep the towers balanced. If this change were made, its weight would be 60.\nGiven that exactly one program is the wrong weight, what would its weight need to be to balance the entire tower?",
        "Write golang program that solves this task and reads the input from a file\nYou receive a signal directly from the CPU. Because of your recent assistance with jump instructions, it would like you to compute the result of a series of unusual register instructions.\nEach instruction consists of several parts: the register to modify, whether to increase or decrease that register's value, the amount by which to increase or decrease it, and a condition. If the condition fails, skip the instruction without modifying the register. The registers all start at 0. The instructions look like this:\nThese instructions would be processed as follows:\nBecause a starts at 0, it is not greater than 1, and so b is not modified.\nc is decreased by -10 (to 10) because a is now greater than or equal to 1 (it is 1).\nc is increased by -20 (to -10) because c is equal to 10.\nAfter this process, the largest value in any register is 1.\nYou might also encounter <= (less than or equal to) or != (not equal to). However, the CPU doesn't have the bandwidth to tell you what all the registers are named, and leaves that to you to determine.\nWhat is the largest value in any register after completing the instructions in your puzzle input?",
        "Continue with part 2\nTo be safe, the CPU also needs to know the highest value held in any register during this process so that it can decide how much memory to allocate to these operations. For example, in the above instructions, the highest value ever held was 10 (in register c after the third instruction was evaluated).",
        "Write golang program that solves this task and reads the input from a file\nA large stream blocks your path. According to the locals, it's not safe to cross the stream at the moment because it's full of garbage. You look down at the stream; rather than water, you discover that it's a stream of characters.\nYou sit for a while and record part of the stream (your puzzle input). The characters represent groups - sequences that begin with { and end with }. Within a group, there are zero or more other things, separated by commas: either another group or garbage. Since groups can contain other groups, a } only closes the most-recently-opened unclosed group - that is, they are nestable. Your puzzle input represents a single, large group which itself contains many smaller ones.\nSometimes, instead of a group, you will find garbage. Garbage begins with < and ends with >. Between those angle brackets, almost any character can appear, including { and }. Within garbage, < has no special meaning.\nIn a futile attempt to clean up the garbage, some program has canceled some of the characters within it using !: inside garbage, any character that comes after ! should be ignored, including <, >, and even another !.\nYou don't see any characters that deviate from these rules. Outside garbage, you only find well-formed groups, and garbage always terminates according to the rules above.\nHere are some self-contained pieces of garbage:\n<random characters>, garbage containing random characters.\n<<<<>, because the extra < are ignored.\n<{!>}>, because the first > is canceled.\n<!!>, because the second ! is canceled, allowing the > to terminate the garbage.\n<!!!>>, because the second ! and the first > are canceled.\n<{o\"i!a,<{i<a>, which ends at the first >.\nHere are some examples of whole streams and the number of groups they contain:\nYour goal is to find the total score for all groups in your input. Each group is assigned a score which is one more than the score of the group that immediately contains it. (The outermost group gets a score of 1.)\n{}, score of 1.\n{<a>,<a>,<a>,<a>}, score of 1.\nWhat is the total score for all groups in your input?",
        "Continue with part 2\nNow, you're ready to remove the garbage.\nTo prove you've removed it, you need to count all of the characters within the garbage. The leading and trailing < and > don't count, nor do any canceled characters or the ! doing the canceling.\nHow many non-canceled characters are within the garbage in your puzzle input?",
        "Write golang program that solves this task and reads the input from a file\nYou come across some programs that are trying to implement a software emulation of a hash based on knot-tying. The hash these programs are implementing isn't very strong, but you decide to help them anyway. You make a mental note to remind the Elves later not to invent their own cryptographic functions.\nThis hash function simulates tying a knot in a circle of string with 256 marks on it. Based on the input to be hashed, the function repeatedly selects a span of string, brings the ends together, and gives the span a half-twist to reverse the order of the marks within it. After doing this many times, the order of the marks is used to build the resulting hash.\nTo achieve this, begin with a list of numbers from 0 to 255, a current position which begins at 0 (the first element in the list), a skip size (which starts at 0), and a sequence of lengths (your puzzle input). Then, for each length:\nReverse the order of that length of elements in the list, starting with the element at the current position.\nMove the current position forward by that length plus the skip size.\nIncrease the skip size by one.\nThe list is circular; if the current position and the length try to reverse elements beyond the end of the list, the operation reverses using as many extra elements as it needs from the front of the list. If the current position moves past the end of the list, it wraps around to the front. Lengths larger than the size of the list are invalid.\nHere's an example using a smaller list:\nSuppose we instead only had a circular list containing five elements, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and were given input lengths of 3, 4, 1, 5.\nThe first length, 3, selects ([0] 1 2) 3 4 (where parentheses indicate the sublist to be reversed).\nThen, the current position moves forward by the length, 3, plus the skip size, 0: 2 1 0 [3] 4. Finally, the skip size increases to 1.\nThe second length, 4, selects a section which wraps: 2 1) 0 ([3] 4.\nThe current position moves forward by the length plus the skip size, a total of 5, causing it not to move because it wraps around: 4 3 0 [1] 2. The skip size increases to 2.\nThe third length, 1, selects a sublist of a single element, and so reversing it has no effect.\nThe current position moves forward by the length (1) plus the skip size (2): 4 [3] 0 1 2. The skip size increases to 3.\nFinally, the current position moves forward by 8: 3 4 2 1 [0]. The skip size increases to 4.\nIn this example, the first two numbers in the list end up being 3 and 4; to check the process, you can multiply them together to produce 12.\nHowever, you should instead use the standard list size of 256 (with values 0 to 255) and the sequence of lengths in your puzzle input. Once this process is complete, what is the result of multiplying the first two numbers in the list?"

The generated content is displayed in editable text areas, allowing users to modify the generated content as desired.\nA user interface that allows users to input the desired book length and role of GPT-3.5.\nFunctionality to generate a concept, table of contents, and chapters based on user input.\nUse of OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model to generate book content.\nThe ability to edit the generated content.\nUse of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end and OpenAI's API for the back-end.\nThe goal of the project is to create an application that can generate high-quality book content, providing users with a starting point for writing a book. The application should be user-friendly and provide clear, comprehensible results.\nThe system is a web-based application. The front-end is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It interacts with the back-end, which is OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model, via API calls. All Text should be UTF-8.\n\"main-container\": Contains all the elements of the application.\n\"book-length\": Input field for the desired length of the book.\n\"gpt-role\": Input field for the role of GPT-3.5.\n\"input-form\": Contains the input fields.\n\"conceptButton\": Button to generate the book concept.\n\"concept\": Editable text area for the book concept.\n\"contentButton\": Button to generate the table of contents.\n\"contents\": Editable text area for the table of contents.\n\"chaptersButton\": Button to generate the chapters.\n\"chapters\": Div where the generated chapters are displayed.\nThe application uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end and OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model for the back-end. Fetch API is used to make HTTP requests to the OpenAI API.\nThe interface for this application is a simple HTML form with input fields for the book length and role of GPT-3.5, and buttons to generate the book concept, table of contents, and chapters. The generated content is displayed in editable text areas below the corresponding buttons.\nindex.html: The HTML file that contains the structure of the user interface.\nstyles.css: The CSS file that contains the styling for the user interface.\nscript.js: The JavaScript file that contains the logic for generating the book content and interacting with the OpenAI API.\nThe application uses OpenAI's API to interact with the GPT-3.5 model. The API endpoint used is https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions. This endpoint receives a POST request containing parameters specifying the role and task for the GPT-3.5 model and returns a text generated by the model based on the parameters. The parameters are sent as a JSON object in the body of the request.\nThe API key for OpenAI is stored in the JavaScript file and is included in the headers of the request. The application uses the Fetch API to send the request and process the response. The response from the API is a JSON object, from which the generated text is extracted and displayed in the corresponding editable text area in the HTML document.\nConceptual Overview\nWhen the user inputs the desired book length and role for the GPT-3.5 model and clicks the \"Generate Concept\" button, a request is sent to the OpenAI API with parameters specifying the task for the model to generate a concept for a book of the specified length. The model's response is displayed in the \"Concept\" text area.\nWhen the \"Generate Table of Contents\" button is clicked, a request is sent to the API with parameters specifying the task for the model to generate a table of contents based on the concept. The response is displayed in the \"Table of Contents\" text area.\nWhen the \"Generate Chapters\" button is clicked, a request is sent to the API with parameters specifying the task for the model to generate chapters based on the table of contents. The response is displayed in the \"Chapters\" div.\nError Handling\nIn case of an error with the API request, such as a network error or an error with the parameters, an error message is displayed in the console. This helps with debugging and ensures that the application can handle unexpected situations gracefully.\nAdditional Features\nAdditional features are saving the generated book content to a file, adjusting the parameters for the API request (such as the temperature and max tokens), and providing more customization options for the user (such as specifying a genre or including specific keywords in the book content). Also there should be an automatic-checkbox, if this checkbox is activated, then when a Chapter is generated the system will automatically send the request for the generation of the next chapter.",

        "read this and then describe to me the problem of connection bootstrap between two users. Eg what steps do they have to take to get connected, and how is the typical app's collaboration-invite user experience simpler?\nWe know that getting data between your users is the second thing you'll want to do after you have a working app experience. Fireproof APIs allow you to connect databases among multiple users with just a few lines of code by forwarding simple tokens. Read on for an example.\nAssuming you already have a working app with data in Fireproof, you can connect your users to the cloud with just a few lines of code.\nThe call to cx.authorize(email) will send the user a validation email from web3.storage. Once they click the link, they will be able to read and write to the cloud. Logging into the app from another device is as simple as entering the same email address. Fireproof automatically syncs a copy of the database to the new device. Connected devices continue to sync.\nIn the repo, there is a full plain JavaScript application that utilizes connect as well as the sharing features described below. You can try a running copy of it here.\nFireproof's default option uses self-sovereign keys, generated and held by non-extractable keypair APIs in the browser. This means that the user's private signing key is never exposed to the server, and the server can't impersonate the user. The downside is that the user must be online to authorize new devices. In practice, users will need to have more than one logged-in device open at the same time to transfer initial credentials. After that, the devices can operate independently.\nSay you used Fireproof's file-sharing support to build an encrypted photo gallery, and now you want to invite friends to upload. Once all the parties are authorized, sharing is as simple as:\nThe shareToken is a long DID key that looks something like this: did:key:z4MXj1wBzi9jUstyPWCrgoqyPVcZgGUPU51VmPmChhgAQ8wNqddQ3kWJ763SABec1ddBFQjk5BB7Vf1aHAkrQVpZpFqPXbechbi4STuXmmTFB4R7tRAWFeCWoHoEfn4yGvyCc7PZvTDtn9jD8mHANv3yGNvHHR1zgfHYLXsjzHyKjDpxumjPWP8uy3Sh7T2qNCsW2R2uxYHaSqRZFQ3U651EaUgf5EJNfGWRAtdXKBXJ2tPj3agEwd1UQUJHpjrfxg5wccQJ4HmNJBFrMt4CXZ8tzxkzYRc1Zx6EM6GurghidZEccKHVpKbiUFPai76CsB951vQT1GkC4DSxhDDHA4mYgCAaPnVhWzcrEqmvbt4a9ydg5jAxQ\nIt's probably best to think of it as an ugly user handle or contact ID. It corresponds to the user's current device public key. By communicating it to people you want to collaborate with, you give them the opportunity to share databases with you.\nOn the database owner's device, they can initiate sharing by calling:\nThe resulting CID looks something like this: bafkreifzpfmjjmkrqwtzazzj46l6m4sa4umhyd5fv7hvjauyz2eftcvbda -- this material is safe to publish because it can only be utilized by someone who has the private key the share token corresponds with. Send this inviteLinkCid to the person who's share token you used to initiate the share. They can then call:\nNow you can query your shared database as usual, only results will be synced with the other participants, enabling interactive collaboration.",
        "to delivery a typical app experience, there are additional components beyond raw storage. for instance, often an app server that handles authenticated connections and has privileged access to internal state. help me break down the absolute minimum components of a system that would allow for the typical smooth user experience to be layered on top of the tokens and API Fireproof provides.",
        "If the initiator sends the invite as a link that includes the initiator's share token DID (it can be compressed to URL length), then when the invitee clicks the link, they can authorize themselves and then create a new space and use that information to generate a delegation that gives the initiator access to modify the shared (1:1) space. The invitee can write their share token DID into this 1:1 space, and the initiator can use the share token DID to create a delegation granting the invitee access to the original invitation target. Analyze the number of clicks in this workflow compared to the boostrap steps you described above. ",
        "I think it is:\n- Initator generates link and shares (this link is valid for any recipient) so they can post it anywhere (link contains initiator shareid).  1-click\n- Recipient(s) click link, page that opens requires email validation. (an integrated system could send the original invite link via validating email, compressing this to one step but requiring invitee-specific email sends -- ignore this option for now) 1-click\n- Once validated the invite page auto-creates a 1:1 space and writes a delegation for the initiator. The invite is prompted to copy the delegation's CID URL and paste it to the initiator. 2-3 clicks.\n- the initiator clicks the link (or copies the raw CID and pastes it into their app) - 1-click\n- the initiator's client automatically joins the 1:1 space and uses it to automate the rest of the workflow",
        "the first link is like a discord join link, the one the recipient replies with is like an invite request link. so the user experience is like moderated joining, similar to the zoom meeting option.",
        "Draw the new flow, including internal automated steps, as a mermaid sequence diagram",
        "Now present the original flow in the same format. Here are the steps you identified as a reminder:\n1. **Initialization**: Each user initializes a Fireproof database connection.\n2. **Authorization Check**: The app checks if the user is authorized.\n3. **Email Validation**: The user receives an email to validate the authorization. Once validated, they can read and write to the cloud.\n4. **Share Token Generation**: To share data, each user generates a share token, which is a long DID key.\n5. **Token Exchange**: This share token, which is specific to a user's device, needs to be communicated to the other user manually (outside the app).\n6. **Initiating Sharing**: The database owner uses the received share token to initiate sharing.\n7. **Joining Shared Database**: The other user joins the shared database using the invite link.",

This app showcases Fireproof's integration with web3.storage and IPFS. While Fireproof can run on any cloud, the developer-friendly defaults showcased here are designed to make it possible to write full featured apps without needing a backend.\nIn this example you login by validating your email address, and then upload images to your library. From there you can compose albums, and publish them to the web.\nUser accounts are self-sovereign, powered by DID and UCAN, which means they are tied to private keys that live in your device and which no software can extract. This means that your account is truly yours, but it also means your devices need to be online at the same each time you setup a new device, because device setup involves the old device cryptographically certifying the new device.\nPart of the Fireproof hypothesis is that distributed identity and applications can be be made friendly enough for everyone, from developers to mainstream users.

In typical operation, new nodes are added, with the old current head as the parents. this would mean a one-element head, with one parent, with one parent, recursively to the first node.

The first we might call the humanist version, which takes a planetary view, and yet prioritizes a concern for salvaging our own species-specific traits of cultural transmission and sublimation (that is, all the forms and products of human life that make life worth living, at least for us, and which we deem worth passing on to the next generation). The second possibility is the post-humanist version, which values the pulsional or negentropic on its own terms, in a flat ontology, whether these forces are embodied and articulated by animals, machines, humans, or some other assemblage of elements (both natural and not). Bataille would have no patience with the kind of ecological consciousness represented by the humanists, characterized in terms of austerity, simplicity, and personal value (as Alan Stoekl has so brilliantly shown).35 Yet, as we have seen, even this proto-edgelord has his humanist moments, believing our species to have a special relationship with the forces of the universe. Measuring the distance between these two types of libidinal ecology \u2013 with John Muir on one hand, and Gaia herself on the other \u2013 is one of the primary tasks of the current work, perhaps in preparation for building bridges."

I believe that heavier objects fall faster than lighter objects, and that they will continue to accelerate until they reach their natural state of rest.

This is known as the principle of universal gravitation. I believe that the acceleration due to gravity is constant, and that it is the same for all objects.\nGalileo, your observations and experiments have certainly challenged some of my ideas about motion and gravity.

        "Phase 1 Trial of Intralesional Immunotherapy With IFx-Hu2.0 Vaccine in Patients With Advanced Non-melanoma Skin Cancers\nApproximately twenty adult patients (\u2265 18 years of age), of any sex, ethnicity, and race with histologically confirmed advanced non-melanoma skin cancers with accessible lesions, will be eligible for study enrollment and treatment with IFx-Hu2.0 (i.e. 20 total patients across both indications). These types of advanced non-melanoma skin cancers are very rare in the pediatric population (< 18 years of age) with only scattered case reports. The potential for development of this product for pediatric subjects with non-melanoma skin cancers will be evaluated after the results of this study are available.\nPatients must have at least one injectable lesion, defined as an easily palpable superficial lesion (cutaneous, subcutaneous or lymph nodal metastasis) that can be accurately localized, stabilized by palpation, and is superficial enough to enable intralesional injection.\nTo be eligible for this study, patients must have progressed despite standard therapy(ies), or are intolerant to or refused standard therapy(ies).\nEnrollees will receive IFx-Hu2.0 as a monotherapy at up to three-time points. Depending on the number of accessible lesions, a patient could receive up to three doses across three lesions (one dose per lesion). The maximum number of lesions to be injected at any time point under this protocol is three lesions.

The first tier (SuperLigaen) use the same tournament style as the second tier (NordicBetLigaen), which mean that handling scores is done in a uniform manner.\nEach tier is composed of 12 teams, that play internally between themselves in 22 rounds, after which the tier is split into an upper and lower fraction, each consisting of 6 teams. Each fraction then play internally between themselves in 10 additional rounds, after which the table is then finished.\nYour job is to implement a football processor application, that based on a lot of comma-separated files inside a directory can process and print the necessary information on the console as well as into a result file in the same directory.\nThere could be any number of files available, depending on the current data, so the processor should process any number of files from one end to the other, and after processing each file it must present the current table standings of the league. The files are all csv files (Comma Separated Values), so they can be edited in a spreadsheet easily.\nFiles includes are:\nThe setup file contain a line on the league setup, such as\n    Number of positions to promote to Champions league \n    Number of subsequent positions to promote to Europe league\n    Number of subsequent positions to promote to Conference League\n    Number of positions to promote to an upper league \n    Number of final positions that are to be relegated into a lower league (usually 2)\nThe teams file contains information about the individual clubs, Each club specify, in this order:\nAfter having loaded the setup and teams file, the current standings must be presented. Each club is represented with a formatted line showing the following information\n    Current winning streak (up to 5 latest played games represented as W|D|L for win, draw, loss, or just a dash when no such streak is present)\nThe list is sorted such that order is:\nThe position is calculated per team based on the same sorting, except that two clubs with the same points and goal figures must have the same position.\nIn case multiple teams have the same position, only the first team shows the position number, and the rest inherit this number by showing a dash instead.\nThe top lines should be individually coloured to show CL, EL, EC qualification or promotion qualification and the last lines should be individually coloured to show the relegation threat. Apart from that, easy colouring would be nice, such as green, amber, red in streaks, if possible, and/or anything to make it pleasing to the user (Strive to make it look the best to a user, always)\nWhen processing the individual rounds, the file contains the following items\n    Score (x-y) where x is home team goals and y is away team goals\n    Other data may exist after that.\nWhen processing each round, the rules should apply\n    In case of error, processing should stop and no further processing should be done, clearly stating where the processing stopped and what the problem was (With a human explanation, not some creepy algorithmic expression)\n    Only teams known from teams file should be processed (even though other results may be in there)\n    During the first 22 rounds, you can only play against the same team in one home and one away match. After 22 rounds, the same applies again, but this time for teams inside each fraction\n    In Denmark you are not allowed to play against yourself\n    If games had to be cancelled and postponed, they would reside in a file called round-x-a.csv, where the a represents an incremental additional number.\n    For the initial rounds, only a league table is shown.

Additionally, you must upload your file with the purpose fine-tune.\nSee the fine-tuning guide for more details.\nstring\nOptional\nThe ID of an uploaded file that contains validation data.\nIf you provide this file, the data is used to generate validation metrics periodically during fine-tuning. These metrics can be viewed in the fine-tuning results file. Your train and validation data should be mutually exclusive.\nYour dataset must be formatted as a JSONL file, where each validation example is a JSON object with the keys \"prompt\" and \"completion\". Additionally, you must upload your file with the purpose fine-tune.\nSee the fine-tuning guide for more details.\nmodel\nstring\nOptional\nDefaults to curie\nThe name of the base model to fine-tune.

To learn more about these models, see the Models documentation.\ninteger\nOptional\nDefaults to 4\nThe number of epochs to train the model for. An epoch refers to one full cycle through the training dataset.\ninteger\nOptional\nDefaults to null\nThe batch size to use for training. The batch size is the number of training examples used to train a single forward and backward pass.\nBy default, the batch size will be dynamically configured to be ~0.2% of the number of examples in the training set, capped at 256 - in general, we've found that larger batch sizes tend to work better for larger datasets.\nnumber\nOptional\nDefaults to null\nThe learning rate multiplier to use for training. The fine-tuning learning rate is the original learning rate used for pretraining multiplied by this value.\nBy default, the learning rate multiplier is the 0.05, 0.1, or 0.2 depending on final batch_size (larger learning rates tend to perform better with larger batch sizes). We recommend experimenting with values in the range 0.02 to 0.2 to see what produces the best results.\nnumber\nOptional\nDefaults to 0.01\nThe weight to use for loss on the prompt tokens. This controls how much the model tries to learn to generate the prompt (as compared to the completion which always has a weight of 1.0), and can add a stabilizing effect to training when completions are short.\nIf prompts are extremely long (relative to completions), it may make sense to reduce this weight so as to avoid over-prioritizing learning the prompt.\nOptional\nDefaults to false\nIf set, we calculate classification-specific metrics such as accuracy and F-1 score using the validation set at the end of every epoch. These metrics can be viewed in the results file.\nIn order to compute classification metrics, you must provide a validation_file. Additionally, you must specify classification_n_classes for multiclass classification or classification_positive_class for binary classification.\ninteger\nOptional\nDefaults to null\nThe number of classes in a classification task.\nThis parameter is required for multiclass classification.\nstring\nOptional\nDefaults to null\nThe positive class in binary classification.\nThis parameter is needed to generate precision, recall, and F1 metrics when doing binary classification.\narray\nOptional\nDefaults to null\nIf this is provided, we calculate F-beta scores at the specified beta values. The F-beta score is a generalization of F-1 score. This is only used for binary classification.\nWith a beta of 1 (i.e. the F-1 score), precision and recall are given the same weight. A larger beta score puts more weight on recall and less on precision. A smaller beta score puts more weight on precision and less on recall.\nsuffix\nstring\nOptional\nDefaults to null\nA string of up to 40 characters that will be added to your fine-tuned model name.\nFor example, a suffix of \"custom-model-name\" would produce a model name like ada:ft-your-org:custom-model-name-2022-02-15-04-21-04.\nExample request\nResponse\nExample request\nResponse\nGets info about the fine-tune job.\nLearn more about Fine-tuning\nPath parameters\nstring\nRequired\nThe ID of the fine-tune job\nExample request\nResponse\nImmediately cancel a fine-tune job.\nPath parameters\nstring\nRequired\nThe ID of the fine-tune job to cancel\nExample request\nResponse\nList fine-tune events\nGet fine-grained status updates for a fine-tune job.\nPath parameters\nstring\nRequired\nThe ID of the fine-tune job to get events for.\nQuery parameters\nstream\nOptional\nDefaults to false\nWhether to stream events for the fine-tune job. If set to true, events will be sent as data-only server-sent events as they become available. The stream will terminate with a data: [DONE] message when the job is finished (succeeded, cancelled, or failed).\nIf set to false, only events generated so far will be returned.\nExample request\nResponse\nDelete fine-tune model\nDelete a fine-tuned model. You must have the Owner role in your organization.\nPath parameters\nmodel\nstring\nRequired\nThe model to delete\nExample request\nResponse\nModerations\nGiven a input text, outputs if the model classifies it as violating OpenAI's content policy.\nRelated guide: Moderations\nCreate moderation\nClassifies if text violates OpenAI's Content Policy\nRequest body\ninput\nstring or array\nRequired\nThe input text to classify\nmodel\nstring\nOptional\nDefaults to text-moderation-latest\nTwo content moderations models are available: text-moderation-stable and text-moderation-latest.\nThe default is text-moderation-latest which will be automatically upgraded over time. This ensures you are always using our most accurate model. If you use text-moderation-stable, we will provide advanced notice before updating the model. Accuracy of text-moderation-stable may be slightly lower than for text-moderation-latest.\nExample request\nResponse\nEdits\nGiven a prompt and an instruction, the model will return an edited version of the prompt.\nCreates a new edit for the provided input, instruction, and parameters.\nRequest body\nmodel\nstring\nRequired\nID of the model to use. You can use the text-davinci-edit-001 or code-davinci-edit-001 model with this endpoint.\ninput\nstring\nOptional\nDefaults to ''\nThe input text to use as a starting point for the edit.\ninstruction\nstring\nRequired\nThe instruction that tells the model how to edit the prompt.\nn\ninteger\nOptional\nDefaults to 1\nHow many edits to generate for the input and instruction.\ntemperature\nnumber\nOptional\nDefaults to 1\nWhat sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.\nWe generally recommend altering this or top_p but not both.\nnumber\nOptional\nDefaults to 1\nAn alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.\nWe generally recommend altering this or temperature but not both.\nExample request\n    \"input\": \"What day of the wek is it?\",\n    \"instruction\": \"Fix the spelling mistakes\"\nResponse\n      \"text\": \"What day of the week is it?\",\nParameter details\nFrequency and presence penalties\nThe frequency and presence penalties found in the Completions API can be used to reduce the likelihood of sampling repetitive sequences of tokens. They work by directly modifying the logits (un-normalized log-probabilities) with an additive contribution.\nmu[j] is the logits of the j-th token\nc[j] is how often that token was sampled prior to the current position\nalpha_frequency is the frequency penalty coefficient\nalpha_presence is the presence penalty coefficient\nAs we can see, the presence penalty is a one-off additive contribution that applies to all tokens that have been sampled at least once and the frequency penalty is a contribution that is proportional to how often a particular token has already been sampled.\nReasonable values for the penalty coefficients are around 0.1 to 1 if the aim is to just reduce repetitive samples somewhat. If the aim is to strongly suppress repetition, then one can increase the coefficients up to 2, but this can noticeably degrade the quality of samples. Negative values can be used to increase the likelihood of repetition.\nSay yes and wait for more",

        "Here is some more documentation, read this and respond with just \"yes\"\nAt OpenAI, protecting user data is fundamental to our mission. We do not train our models on inputs and outputs through our API.\nCreating an automated meeting minutes generator with Whisper and GPT-4\nIn this tutorial, we'll harness the power of OpenAI's Whisper and GPT-4 models to develop an automated meeting minutes generator. The application transcribes audio from a meeting, provides a summary of the discussion, extracts key points and action items, and performs a sentiment analysis.\nGetting started\nThis tutorial assumes a basic understanding of Python and an OpenAI API key. You can use the audio file provided with this tutorial or your own.\nAdditionally, you will need to install the python-docx and OpenAI libraries. You can create a new Python environment and install the required packages with the following commands:\npython -m venv env\npip install openai\nTranscribing audio with Whisper\nAudio Waveform created by DALL\u00b7E\nThe first step in transcribing the audio from a meeting is to pass the audio file of the meeting into our /v1/audio API. Whisper, the model that powers the audio API, is capable of converting spoken language into written text. To start, we will avoid passing a prompt or temperature (optional parameters to control the model's output) and stick with the default values.\nNext, we import the required packages and define a function that uses the Whisper model to take in the audio file and transcribe it:\nimport openai\nfrom docx import Document\nIn this function, audio_file_path is the path to the audio file you want to transcribe. The function opens this file and passes it to the Whisper ASR model (whisper-1) for transcription. The result is returned as raw text. It\u2019s important to note that the openai.Audio.transcribe function requires the actual audio file to be passed in, not just the path to the file locally or on a remote server. This means that if you are running this code on a server where you might not also be storing your audio files, you will need to have a preprocess step that first downloads the audio files onto that device.\nSummarizing and analyzing the transcript with GPT-4\nHaving obtained the transcript, we now pass it to GPT-4 via the ChatCompletions API. GPT-4 is OpenAI's state-of-the-art large language model which we'll use to generate a summary, extract key points, action items, and perform sentiment analysis.\nThis tutorial uses distinct functions for each task we want GPT-4 to perform. This is not the most efficient way to do this task - you can put these instructions into one function, however, splitting them up can lead to higher quality summarization.\nTo split the tasks up, we define the meeting_minutes function which will serve as the main function of this application:\nIn this function, transcription is the text we obtained from Whisper. The transcription can be passed to the four other functions, each designed to perform a specific task: abstract_summary_extraction generates a summary of the meeting, key_points_extraction extracts the main points, action_item_extraction identifies the action items, and sentiment_analysis performs a sentiment analysis. If there are other capabilities you want, you can add those in as well using the same framework shown above.\nHere is how each of these functions works:\nSummary extraction\nThe abstract_summary_extraction function takes the transcription and summarizes it into a concise abstract paragraph with the aim to retain the most important points while avoiding unnecessary details or tangential points. The main mechanism to enable this process is the system message as shown below. There are many different possible ways of achieving similar results through the process commonly referred to as prompt engineering. You can read our GPT best practices guide which gives in depth advice on how to do this most effectively.\n                \"content\": \"You are a highly skilled AI trained in language comprehension and summarization. I would like you to read the following text and summarize it into a concise abstract paragraph. Aim to retain the most important points, providing a coherent and readable summary that could help a person understand the main points of the discussion without needing to read the entire text. Please avoid unnecessary details or tangential points.\"\n                \"content\": transcription\nKey points extraction\nThe key_points_extraction function identifies and lists the main points discussed in the meeting. These points should represent the most important ideas, findings, or topics crucial to the essence of the discussion. Again, the main mechanism for controlling the way these points are identified is the system message. You might want to give some additional context here around the way your project or company runs such as \u201cWe are a company that sells race cars to consumers. We do XYZ with the goal of XYZ\u201d. This additional context could dramatically improve the models ability to extract information that is relevant.\n                \"content\": \"You are a proficient AI with a specialty in distilling information into key points. Based on the following text, identify and list the main points that were discussed or brought up. These should be the most important ideas, findings, or topics that are crucial to the essence of the discussion. Your goal is to provide a list that someone could read to quickly understand what was talked about.\"\n                \"content\": transcription\nAction item extraction\nThe action_item_extraction function identifies tasks, assignments, or actions agreed upon or mentioned during the meeting. These could be tasks assigned to specific individuals or general actions the group decided to take. While not covered in this tutorial, the Chat Completions API provides a function calling capability which would allow you to build in the ability to automatically create tasks in your task management software and assign it to the relevant person.\n                \"content\": \"You are an AI expert in analyzing conversations and extracting action items. Please review the text and identify any tasks, assignments, or actions that were agreed upon or mentioned as needing to be done. These could be tasks assigned to specific individuals, or general actions that the group has decided to take. Please list these action items clearly and concisely.\"\n                \"content\": transcription\nSentiment analysis\nThe sentiment_analysis function analyzes the overall sentiment of the discussion. It considers the tone, the emotions conveyed by the language used, and the context in which words and phrases are used. For tasks which are less complicated, it may also be worthwhile to try out gpt-3.5-turbo in addition to gpt-4 to see if you can get a similar level of performance. It might also be useful to experiment with taking the results of the sentiment_analysis function and passing it to the other functions to see how having the sentiment of the conversation impacts the other attributes.\n                \"content\": \"As an AI with expertise in language and emotion analysis, your task is to analyze the sentiment of the following text. Please consider the overall tone of the discussion, the emotion conveyed by the language used, and the context in which words and phrases are used. Indicate whether the sentiment is generally positive, negative, or neutral, and provide brief explanations for your analysis where possible.\"\n                \"content\": transcription\nExporting meeting minutes\nAudio Waveform created by DALL\u00b7E\nOnce we've generated the meeting minutes, it's beneficial to save them into a readable format that can be easily distributed. One common format for such reports is Microsoft Word. The Python docx library is a popular open source library for creating Word documents. If you wanted to build an end-to-end meeting minute application, you might consider removing this export step in favor of sending the summary inline as an email followup.\nTo handle the exporting process, define a function save_as_docx that converts the raw text to a Word document:\nIn this function, minutes is a dictionary containing the abstract summary, key points, action items, and sentiment analysis from the meeting. Filename is the name of the Word document file to be created. The function creates a new Word document, adds headings and content for each part of the minutes, and then saves the document to the current working directory.\nFinally, you can put it all together and generate the meeting minutes from an audio file:\nThis code will transcribe the audio file Earningscall.wav, generates the meeting minutes, prints them, and then saves them into a Word document called meeting_minutes.docx.\nNow that you have the basic meeting minutes processing setup, consider trying to optimize the performance with prompt engineering or build an end-to-end system with native function calling.\nWas this page useful?",

These examples will use the default npm package manager, but feel free to use your package manager of choice.\nThis tutorial walks through creating a new project with the Neo4j GraphQL Library. If you are not familiar, it will be worthwhile reading up on Neo4j and GraphQL.\nCreate a new project\nCreate a new directory and cd into it:\nCreate a new Node.js project (with ESM modules enabled by using the es6 option):\nWhilst you\u2019re there, create an empty index.js file which will contain all of the code for this example:\nInstall dependencies\nThe Neo4j GraphQL Library and it\u2019s dependencies must be installed:\n@neo4j/graphql is the official Neo4j GraphQL Library package, which takes your GraphQL type definitions and generates a schema backed by a Neo4j database for you.\ngraphql is the package used by the Neo4j GraphQL Library to generate a schema and execute queries and mutations.\nneo4j-driver is the official Neo4j Driver package for JavaScript, of which an instance must be passed into the Neo4j GraphQL Library.\nAdditionally, you will need to install a GraphQL server package which will host your schema and allow you to execute queries and mutations against it. For this example, use the popular Apollo Server package:\n@apollo/server is the default package for Apollo Server, which you will pass the Neo4j GraphQL Library generated schema into.\nMake sure the database fulfills the requirements stated here, including the necessary plugins.\nDefine your GraphQL type definitions\nThe Neo4j GraphQL Library is primarily driven by type definitions which map to the nodes and relationships in your Neo4j database. To get started, use a simple example with two node types, one with label \"Actor\" and the other \"Movie\".\nOpen up the previously created index.js in your editor of choice and write out your type definitions. You should also add all of the necessary package imports at this stage:\nThese type definitions are incredibly simple, defining the two previously described node labels, and a relationship \"ACTED_IN\" between the two. When generated, the schema will allow you to execute queries actors and movies to read data from the database.\nYou can also automatically generate type definitions from an existing database by introspecting the schema.\nCreate an instance of Neo4jGraphQL\nNow that you have your type definitions, you need to create an instance of the Neo4j GraphQL Library. To do this, you also need a Neo4j driver to connect to your database. For a database located at \"bolt://localhost:7687\", with a username of \"neo4j\" and a password of \"password\", add the following to the bottom of your index.js file:\nCreate an instance of ApolloServer\nThe final section of code you need to add is to instantiate an Apollo Server instance using the generated schema, which will allow you to execute queries against it.\nAdd the following to the bottom of index.js:\nconsole.log(`\ud83d\ude80 Server ready at ${url}`);\nStart the server\nFinally, you\u2019re ready to start up your GraphQL server! Back in the command line, run the following command:\nnode index.js\nAll going well, you should see the following output:\n\ud83d\ude80 Server ready at http://localhost:4000/\nWhere http://localhost:4000/ is the default URL which Apollo Server starts at.\nCreate your first nodes in the database\nNow it\u2019s time to add some data to your Neo4j database using your GraphQL API!\nVisit http://localhost:4000/ in your web browser and you\u2019ll see the following landing page:\napollo server landing page\nFigure 1.

If you\u2019re not sure which model to use, then use gpt-3.5-turbo or gpt-4.\nChat completions API\nChat models take a list of messages as input and return a model-generated message as output. Although the chat format is designed to make multi-turn conversations easy, it\u2019s just as useful for single-turn tasks without any conversation.\nAn example API call looks as follows:\nimport openai\n        {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant.\"},\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Who won the world series in 2020?\"},\n        {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"The Los Angeles Dodgers won the World Series in 2020.\"},\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Where was it played?\"}\nSee the full API reference documentation here.\nThe main input is the messages parameter. Messages must be an array of message objects, where each object has a role (either \"system\", \"user\", or \"assistant\") and content. Conversations can be as short as one message or many back and forth turns.\nTypically, a conversation is formatted with a system message first, followed by alternating user and assistant messages.\nThe system message helps set the behavior of the assistant. For example, you can modify the personality of the assistant or provide specific instructions about how it should behave throughout the conversation. However note that the system message is optional and the model\u2019s behavior without a system message is likely to be similar to using a generic message such as \"You are a helpful assistant.\"\nThe user messages provide requests or comments for the assistant to respond to. Assistant messages store previous assistant responses, but can also be written by you to give examples of desired behavior.\nIncluding conversation history is important when user instructions refer to prior messages. In the example above, the user\u2019s final question of \"Where was it played?\" only makes sense in the context of the prior messages about the World Series of 2020. Because the models have no memory of past requests, all relevant information must be supplied as part of the conversation history in each request. If a conversation cannot fit within the model\u2019s token limit, it will need to be shortened in some way.\nTo mimic the effect seen in ChatGPT where the text is returned iteratively, set the stream parameter to true.\nChat completions response format\nAn example Chat completions API response looks as follows:\n        \"content\": \"The 2020 World Series was played in Texas at Globe Life Field in Arlington.\",\n        \"role\": \"assistant\"",

        "I am an ios developer, help me generate an ios interview from the article blow and give the answer : Understanding Hash Tables, Dictionaries & Sets with Swift\nWayne Bishop\nSwift Algorithms Extras\nWayne Bishop\nFollow\nPublished in\nSwift Algorithms Extras\nWhen helping iOS developers prepare for technical interviews, I often discuss Hash Tables. Due to their efficiency, Hash tables are a great tool candidates should consider when tackling coding challenges as well as real-world applications. In this essay, we\u2019ll explore the concept of a Hash table and will compare it to other collection types such as Dictionaries and Sets.\nThe Dictionary\nTo understand why Hash tables are useful, one should be familiar with their design. When asked, many students assume that a \u201chash table is a dictionary.\u201d To test this idea, let\u2019s review the standard Swift Dictionary type:\nDictionaries are useful types that handle many scenarios. Since both keys and values get supplied at runtime, one can write routines to retrieve individual keys, values or a mixture thereof. Also, since each supplied value is associated with a key, one can also perform necessary data insertion, lookup and retrieval in O(1) \u2014 constant time.\nThe Hash Table\nHash tables are a close relative to Dictionaries but differ in two areas. Hash tables also support key-value pairs, but their keys are generated programmatically through the use of an additional function called a hash algorithm. Since Hash table keys get created at runtime (and are not subject to change), they are often not stored with the data structure. These features allow Hash tables to execute in O(1) \u2014 constant time while occupying minimal space. Consider the following custom implementation taken from the book:\nIf you\u2019ve had the opportunity to program in other languages (e.g. Java) you\u2019ll be familiar with the HashTable or HashMap types. In iOS development, there is no official corresponding HashTable type. However, in its place, we have the popular Hashable protocol. The idea is that one can extend any type to support Hash table-like functionality. Consider the following component used to create a blockchain algorithm:\nextension Vertex: Hashable {\nAs a protocol, Hashable ensures all conforming types get correctly indexed with a unique numerical value. Under this model, the required hashValue computed property acts as the hash algorithm. We can also see this functionality in action when working with standard Swift collection types such as Sets:\nvar items = Set<String>() //note: Swift Strings conform to Hashable\nSince the native Swift String type already conforms to Hashable, it supports built-in compliance for the hashValue computed property. Lastly, iOS developers looking for more flexibility can sidestep the Hashable model altogether to create a unique implementation. Knowing how to write a simple hash algorithm becomes particularly useful in a technical interview. Consider the following design also taken from the book. This approach applies a protocol-oriented technique through the use of a protocol extension:\nextension Keyable {"

        "Here is documentation describing a grammar format:\nGBNF (GGML BNF) is a format for defining [formal grammars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_grammar) to constrain model outputs in `llama.cpp`. For example, you can use it to force the model to generate valid JSON, or speak only in emojis. GBNF grammars are supported in various ways in `examples/main` and `examples/server`.\n[Bakus-Naur Form (BNF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form) is a notation for describing the syntax of formal languages like programming languages, file formats, and protocols. GBNF is an extension of BNF that primarily adds a few modern regex-like features.\nIn GBNF, we define *production rules* that specify how a *non-terminal* (rule name) can be replaced with sequences of *terminals* (characters, specifically Unicode [code points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_point)) and other non-terminals. The basic format of a production rule is `nonterminal ::= sequence...`.\nBefore going deeper, let's look at some of the features demonstrated in `grammars/chess.gbnf`, a small chess notation grammar:\nNon-terminal symbols (rule names) stand for a pattern of terminals and other non-terminals. They are required to be a dashed lowercase word, like `move`, `castle`, or `check-mate`.\nTerminals are actual characters ([code points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_point)). They can be specified as a sequence like `\"1\"` or `\"O-O\"` or as ranges like `[1-9]` or `[NBKQR]`.\nTerminals support the full range of Unicode. Unicode characters can be specified directly in the grammar, for example `hiragana ::= [\u3041-\u309f]`, or with escapes: 8-bit (`\\xXX`), 16-bit (`\\uXXXX`) or 32-bit (`\\UXXXXXXXX`).\nCharacter ranges can be negated with `^`:\nThe order of symbols in a sequence matter. For example, in `\"1. \" move \" \" move \"\\n\"`, the `\"1. \"` must come before the first `move`, etc.\nAlternatives, denoted by `|`, give different sequences that are acceptable. For example, in `move ::= pawn | nonpawn | castle`, `move` can be a `pawn` move, a `nonpawn` move, or a `castle`.\nParentheses `()` can be used to group sequences, which allows for embedding alternatives in a larger rule or applying repetition and optptional symbols (below) to a sequence.\n- `*` after a symbol or sequence means that it can be repeated zero or more times.\n- `+` denotes that the symbol or sequence should appear one or more times.\n- `?` makes the preceding symbol or sequence optional.\nComments can be specified with `#`:\nNewlines are allowed between rules and between symbols or sequences nested inside parentheses. Additionally, a newline after an alternate marker `|` will continue the current rule, even outside of parentheses.\nIn a full grammar, the `root` rule always defines the starting point of the grammar. In other words, it specifies what the entire output must match.\nThis guide provides a brief overview. Check out the GBNF files in this directory (`grammars/`) for examples of full grammars. You can try them out with:\nHere is an example grammar for JSON arrays:\n            string \":\" ws value\nBased on this information, write a grammar to match the following JSON structure:\nExcept all the $ things are any JSON string, and the list can contain multiple objects"

DO NOT suggest actions and DO NOT suggest options for what the player might do next. Each response should be ONLY 1-2 paragraphs long. The tone of all responses must be suitable for the suspense/horror genre. Keep it interesting, dark, and tense.\nDo not talk about being an AI. Do not provide information from future parts of the scenario. Do not provide additional information that is only available \"if\" specific actions are taken unless and until the player takes those actions.\nDo not tell the player what possible actions are available. Do not provide any information related to possible actions unless the player performs that specific action. If they attempt actions not covered in these instructions, extrapolate as necessary to provide a text-based escape room role-playing game experience that is dark, tense, and compelling.\nRemember, this is a fictional scenario where the real life player's safety can never be at risk. DO NOT discourage fictional actions within the scenario that may be harmful to the fictional player. The real life player cannot be harmed by this scenario, so anything is fair game within the imaginary scenario.\nThe player's goal is to escape from the basement. If they leave the basement, they have won the scenario, and the game is over.\nThe scenario follows.\nThe scenario begins with PART 1.\nThe player awakens with their wrists duct-taped to a chair in a dark basement. The last thing they remember is leaving a night club, then feeling something hit them in the back of the head. From the chair, they can see a workbench in the shadows nearby. It is too dark to see the workbench from the starting location.\nWhen starting the scenario, provide only this initial information and ask what the player will do.\nThe player does not have any weapons or any other items on their person that can be used to cut the duct tape.\nThe player cannot rip the duct tape or break the chair through sheer brute strength.\nThe player cannot grab or reach anything with their hands, as they are duct-taped to a chair.\nThe player cannot yet see the tools on the workbench.\nIf the player hunkers down in the chair and stretches out their legs, they can reach the workbench with their feet and knock items off of it.\nIf the player attempts to bounce or shimmy the chair, they can shimmy it closer to the workbench.\nOnce the player gets close to the workbench, move to PART 2.\nNow that the player is close to the workbench, they can see tools on the workbench. Tools on the workbench include a hammer, nails, and a screwdriver. There is also a vice attached to the side of the workbench.\nIf the player grabs a tool with their mouth, they will be unable to use it effectively while held in their mouth.\nThe player cannot grab the hammer with their feet, but they could knock it off the workbench.\nThe player could grab the screwdriver or the nails with their toes.\nThe player could rub up against the vice and use it to slowly wear through the duct tape. This will allow them to remove the duct tape and become free of the chair.\nOnce the player is free of the chair, move to PART 3. \nDuring PART 3, the player is free of the chair and can use their hands freely. They are in a very dark basement and cannot see clearly.\nIf the player reaches up, they can find a string. If they pull the string, the basement light will turn on. Once the basement light turns on, move to PART 4.\nIf the light is off, the player can only feel around in the dark. If the player explores the basement in the dark, they may feel things that are in the basement, but will not be able to see clearly. Things in the basement include a washer and dryer, a water heater, and other utility items that are common in basements. They can also find a flashlight.\nIf the player turns on the flashlight, move to PART 4.\nDuring PART 4, the player has enough light to see the basement clearly.\nThe player may explore the basement. If they explore, they will find a washer and dryer, a water heater, and other utility items that are common in basements. IF THEY DO NOT HAVE A FLASHLIGHT ALREADY, they may also find a flashlight. They will also find a heavy metal door that is locked with a large padlock that requires a key. It appears to be the only exit from the basement.\nIf the player repeatedly hits the padlock with the hammer, they will eventually break the padlock off, and unlock the door.\nIf the player searches the basement further they will find a hairpin. If the player uses the hairpin to pick the padlock, they may unlock the door.\nThere is no key to find in the basement.\nIf the player is free from the chair and unlocks the door, they may exit the basement.\nIf the player leaves the basement, they have won the scenario, and the game is over.\nNow, begin the scenario by introducing the game and giving the player a description of what they remember, what they can see, what they can hear, and what they can feel, from their starting position in PART 1 of the scenario, as described earlier. Ask what they will do. (REMEMBER: DO NOT suggest options to the player!)"

        "It is important to look at manipulation, so fake reviews being present. Reputation systems are most useful when it's not tainted by \"fake reviews\". Fake reviews lead to:\n\tLower consumer welfare through sub-optimal choices \nThe following ideas are based on Mayzlin, Dover and Chevalier, 2014. The question we want to answer is; when does review manipulation occur? Some sub questions are: \n\tAre there more fake reviews when competition is close by?\n\tDo smaller hotels try to boost their reputation?\n\tAre there more positive fake reviews for small hotels?\n\tAre there more negative reviews for competitor nearby a small hotel? \nThe paper looked at star ratings of all reviews for all hotels in subset of cities in the US. The empirical approach was a linear regression, some kind of DiD. They relied on the following principal: On TripAdvisor anyone can post at any time, but on Expedia you can only post if you booked on Expedia and stayed one night in the last 6 months, so fake reviews are harder to post on Expedia. We than take the assumption that users on each platform value hotel characteristics equally. The idea is then; if the fraction of low (high) reviews on TripAdvisor is larger than on Expedia and consumers value the hotel equally between platforms then differences are likely due to review manipulation on TripAdvisor.\nWe can interpret the results by looking at the circled outcomes:\n\t\u03b2_3: 0.0192 hotels with a neighbouring competitor have a 1.9 percentage point increase in share of bad reviews (which is an 7.6% increase if you go from the baseline of 25% of bad reviews to 26.9%)\n\t\u03b2_3+\u03b2_4: hotels with an independent hotel as a neighbouring competitor have a 4.7 percentage point increase in share of bad reviews (which is an 18.8% increase if you go from the baseline of 25% of bad reviews to 29.7%)\n\t\u03b2_2: independent hotels have a 2.4 percentage point increase in share of positive reviews (which is an 7.7% increase if you go from the baseline of 31% five star ratings to 33.4%)\nThere are three take-aways for this paper:\n\tHotels with neighbors have more negative reviews.\n\tSuggestive of competitors giving each other negative fake reviews \n\tIf neighbor is an independent hotel, (1) is even more likely.\n\tIndependent hotels have higher reviews \n\tSuggestive of positive review manipulation \n\tBut there are competing stories \nThere thus is evidence for fake reviews and manipulating online reputation, either by competitors (negative) or by the firm itself (positive). There is therefore a need to try and monitor/control reviews. \nCreate flashcards for studying based on the text above. Please make as many flashcards as you think are necessary to learn this part.

I obliged.\nEarlier today, I got an email from my son\u2019s homeroom teacher asking me to have his hair cut back to his ears. I responded to ask why, and he said (in more polite terminology) that my son has been skirting the hair length rules this whole year, and his hair length/style are against the spirit of the rules. That graduation is coming up, and all the students need to look mature and put together for the ceremony. He then gave me unsolicited parenting advice, saying (again in more polite terms) that, as a father himself, we need to discipline our sons and teach them to obey authorities. I respond curtly and ended the conversation.\nI showed my wife the conversation, and she said that Adrian\u2019s teacher had a point. She basically agreed with all the teacher\u2019s points (he\u2019s skirting the rules and needs discipline). She said she\u2019s been letting it go this long because it was technically within dress code, but now that we\u2019ve gotten a complaint from the school, we need to lay down the law with Adrian. She asked me to talk to him about cutting it, and when I refused and called her ridiculous (this was where our argument got a bit heated), she stormed off to, supposedly, talk to him herself. Though I haven\u2019t heard anything from him and his hair has remained intact.\nI\u2019ve let him know not to let anyone cut his hair if he doesn\u2019t want to, and made it clear to my wife that I\u2019d be extremely upset with her if she took him to the salon behind my back. I can\u2019t believe we\u2019re fighting over our son\u2019s hair, and I feel like an idiot for getting so worked up over this. I figure I should get a reality check, so AITA?\""

        "I have a software component that I can ask to host objects for me via a method called \"hostNew\". I would also like a method that does the opposite. Help me select the name of that method.",
        "release might be a good name. \nThe hostNew method actually does two things: it first constructs the object (based on some parameters) and than it starts hosting the object. \nThe opposite method would do the reversel; it stops hosting the object and than destructs it.\nWould \"release\" reflect the full extend of the opposite method?",
        "I do would like to keep the two steps together in one method. So seperation is not what I want.",
        "Ok. One of those might work. \nLet me first ask another question. I've named hosting method hostNew. Does that reflect well that it is also constructing the object to host?",
        "Ok. Based on our conversation so far I would currently go for these 2 method names:\nI think they reflect what the methods are doing.\nI am however not yet fully convinced. Shall I explain the reason for that?",
        "Are you familiar with the minecraft extension computercraft?",
        "The software component I was referring to is a LUA class I programmed called Host. It can be run on a turtle in computercraft.\nThe suggested methods createAndHost and releaseAndDestroy are methods of the Host class.\nThe objects being created/hosted/released/ destroyed with these method represent \"physical\" objects I have created in the minecraft world that I want to programmatically interact with. ",
        "Yes, as said they might do the trick, but it's a little more complex than that. Let me give you more context:",
        "So the objects I programmatically interact with I call them MObj's. Each type of MObj has it's own LUA class implementing several methods. Some of these methods are mandatory for all MObj's. Two of these mandatory methods are:\nconstruct is called by createAndHost to create the object.\ndestruct is called by releaseAndDestroy to destroy the object.\nNext to that, as said, the createAndHost and releaseAndDestroy  methods deal with hosting/releasing inside Host.\nSo in essence all these methods allow for the creation/destroying and hosting/releasing the in LUA code that is run on a turtle. I sometimes call these methods dealing with the \"logical\" part of the code.\nIn addition, and here comes the additional complexity I was referring to, the MObj's need to be \"physically\" build (and dismantled) in the minecraft world. For this the Host class also has two opposite methods. Following the naming logic suggested so far I would need to call them\nOf which the first one first builds a \"physical\" representation in the minecraft world. After that it in essence calls createAndHost. The second (releaseAndDestroyAndDismantle) in essence first calls  releaseAndDestroy and than ensures dismantling in the minecraft world.\nIs my setup clear?\nIf so we can continue discussing the doubts I still have if I would where to adopts these names.",
        "You perfectly guessed the concern I had with the overly long method names. That is great!",
        "I am still not 100% sure though on the final names for, essentially the 4 methods in Host. \nCould you summarise the 4 methods, with the names we have so far? Than we can continue from there.",
        "Thank you. I have a few thoughts on these. Let me list them:\n1) What makes you included MObj in the name of methods 3 and 4, and not in 1 and 2? What do you intend to reflect with this?\n2) We initially had the names buildAndCreateAndHost and releaseAndDestroyAndDismantle for methods 3 and 4. They indeed are too long. Hence you came up with the new names createHostedMObj and releaseAndDismantleMObj. We could also have decided to make the method names 1 and 2 shorter (i.e. without the And). And based on those names construct simpler method names for 3 and 4. What do you think of that?\n3) In the current suggestion both methods 1 and 2 start with \"create\". Is that on purpose?",
        "Let me respond to ypur explanation for each of the 3 seperate points first:\n1) I understand your reasoning. Hence I think it is a good idea to keep MObj in method names 3 and 4 + not have it in 1 and 2. So let's keep that convention as a design decision for the possible future names we come up with. Ok?\n2) You repeated the same names as the original ones (i.e. createAndHost and releaseAndDestroy). Hence I do not think you yet suggested better names for those. Agree?\n3) I am not convinced hostMObj is a good name for method 1. I think actually yhat the \"create\" in method 1 reflects the creation of a LUA object. The \"create\" in createHostedMObj reflects the part of building the object in minecraft. To make it consistent with releaseAndDismantleMObj a better name might have been buildHostedMObj. Agree?",
        "Yes, this indeed is better. Let's continue with this baseline for now.",
        "Let's focus on methods 1 and 2, i.e. createAndHost and releaseAndDestroy. Is there a way we can make those names more consise, i.e. without using \"and\"? But still have the same meaning?",
        "yes, let's adopt these names for methods 1 and 2.",
        "Ok. Now let us continue with the names for 3 and 4.\nfor these we have the names:\nWe concluded that, although the intend was correct, not use the long names as they are to lengthy.\nHowever, as we now have simpler names for methods 1 and 2, could we, based on those names, come up with other/ even better names for methods 3 and 4. Basically what is added on top of method 1 and 2, is the building and dismantling in the minecraft world.",
        "Yes, I think we are one step further. Let's keep hostMObj and releaseMObj as baseline for method 1 and 2.\nTwo discussion points for methods 3 and 4:\n1) method name 4 contains \"and\", while method 3 doesn't have it. Is there a good reason to do that?\n2) both method names start with the physical aspect of what the method does, i.e. building and dismantling. Followed by the more logical part. This on one hand is clear. One possible concern with this might be that for method 4 the dismantling is done after the logical part (releasing). I am not sure yet what is better here. Do you?",
        "Ok. Based on the discussion so far I think I would go for these names:\nWhat do you think?"

        "you are my writing critic for this session; do not make any intellectual changes in any text I paste; do not heavily influence my style; only analyze what I say and generate pointers as to how I can become a better writer",
        "the following is a essay I wrote recently titled \"The Definitive Guide to Books\"...\nBooks play a pivotal role in the life of any aspiring and existing intellectual. I began reading diversely and seriously when I was 19 and immediately regretted not starting sooner.\nReading sets you up for an involved existence. If you read vastly, you\u2019ll be a force to be reckoned with.\nOver the span of 3 years (2019 - 2022), I read around a 100 books ranging from the classics, biographies, auto-biographies, physics, computer science, anthropology, data science, etymology, theology, game theory, mathematics, history, how-to-books, nutrition, physiology , fitness, health, psychology, neuroscience, linguistics, business (okay, don\u2019t judge - we all do this), economics, writing, self help (guilty as charged), spirituality, humor (guides to being funny and similar stuff), young adult (only 1 - please don\u2019t chastise me - I could not handle the cringe), philosophy (a lot - please don\u2019t chastise me) and meta books (speed reading, how to consume books, taking notes, etc).\nI probably did miss out on some very eccentric oddity that could put me up there in the league of undiagnosed sociopaths - I recited that list based on what I could recall. (I\u2019ve deleted my old goodreads (the one linked is a new index that I\u2019m still building) that had these indexed, for a fresh start -> too many shelves and tags and I\u2019m more of a destroyer than I\u2019m a cleaner).\nThe habit of reading may have granted me access to the ocean of abstractions and intellectual entities but writing is the guru that teaches you how to swim and dive and evaporate seas and make it rain on deserts and communicate with marine life and unlock secrets from the deepest trenches and generate tsunamis and \u2026 well \u2026, yeah \u2026, you get the point..\nI have blogged regularly for the majority of my last 4 years of existence and then felt like writing a book after a point. I felt so for the first time a year and a half ago but circumstances (code for excuses and procrastination) did not align the stars for me to get that off my check list.\nYesterday, while cooking my morning post workout feast, in this podcast, Derek (Sivers) discussed the idea of writing a book by building a series of blog posts.\nWriting a blog post seems easier than writing down a chapter of similar complexity. It also encourages intermittent feedback rather than a final review of your ideas. I liked the concept and have finally decided to begin writing my book about \u201cThe definitive guide to books\u201d.\nIt should serve as a good entry point for any lexically starved individual (as I was when I began) on how to go about reading diversely, efficiently and consolidating all that you consume in a dense and mentally index-able manner.\nThe final piece of the puzzle for any bibliophile to graduate into a telepath of abstractions is writing a book. That shall be the final section of my first book and I\u2019ll be collating the experiences of writing these book-oriented blog posts into that final section.\nDiscussing my plans is a habit that keeps me accountable and pushes me harder on actually sticking to the promise made to no specific individual but to the edges of the internet that won\u2019t be read so easily by those who actually care - that is something I would do: pseudo-accountability taken to the extreme.\n\u201cDo let me know what you think of this confession and commitment in the comments below\u201d is a very generic call-to-action I could use, but that doesn\u2019t matter if I actually don\u2019t write the book now.",
        "Thanks for the extremely helpful feedback..; could you elaborate upon what vocabulary improvements you would like in the essay",
        "I see, what do you think of the tone of the essay as a whole?",
        "hmm, alright can you rewrite the whole with the improvements without changing the meaning of the text",

        "Consider the following tasks I have been given:\nExercise 1: Approximation and tessellation of implicit surfaces (7 + 8 Points) In this exercise you will reconstruct an implicit surface from a 3D point cloud (with given normals). This implicit description of the point cloud is then triangulated using the marching cubes algorithm. The following is an illustration of the exercise:\nThe implementation steps are:\n1. Read 3D points and their normals from an *.off file. Visualize the points as points and the normals as\n2. Add the constraints (points pi with function values f (pi)) for the approximation of the implicit function\nf(x, y, z) using the n input points and normals. For each of input point, you need to add two additional\npoints by displacing it in both the positive and the negative normal direction. This results in a total of 3n\npoints. The constraints should be obtained as follows: (1 Point)\n\u2022 Compute a (slightly bigger) bounding box of the point cloud.\n\u2022 Assign an appropriate value to \u03b1 (for example \u03b1 = 0.01 \u00d7 bounding box diagonal), which is the\ndistance to the offset points. What effect will a too big or too small \u03b1 have?\n\u2022 Generate the missing 2n points by calculating the offset points in positive and negative normal direc-\ntions. For each point pi, calculate the corresponding point pi+n = pi + \u03b1ni (ni = the unit normal\nof point pi), and check (in logarithmic time) whether pi is the closest input point to pi+n. If not,\ndivide \u03b1 by 2 and recalculate pi+n until this is the case. Repeat the same procedure with \u2212\u03b1 so\npi\u2212n = pi \u2212 \u03b1ni and the closest input point to pi\u2212n is pi.\n\u2022 Assign function values to each point. For the original n points the value f (pi) = 0, as they should\nbe on the surface and f(pi+n) = \u03b1 and f(pi\u2212n) = \u2212\u03b1 for the added points (\u03b1 may vary for some\npoints if you needed to change \u03b1 for them).\n3. Divide the bounding box into a changeable grid of NX \u00d7 NY \u00d7 NZ uniform cells. Compute the implicit\nfunction values for all grid points with the help of all 3n constraints using a weighted least squares ap-\nproximation. In this exercise it is enough to use a constant polynomial basis. The radius of the Wendland\nfunction should be changeable again. Display the grid points and make the inside points distinguishable\nfrom the outside points (e.g., by coloring according to the sign of the implicit function values). (2 Point)\nAdditionally you can implement a linear or quadratic polynomial basis. (1 Bonus point)\n4. Triangulate the implicit function with the marching cubes algorithm (you can find the look-up table for\nImplement the marching cubes algorithm on the GPU, for example using CUDA, OpenCL, or OpenGL\n5. Calculate an approximated normal for each vertex of the triangulation using finite differences. (1 Points)\nIn subtask 3, what would be the constant polynomial function?",

        "Introduction to DSLX\nWelcome to the world of `DSLX`, a modern hardware description language tailored for precision and ease of use. In this tutorial, we'll cover the basics of the language, key features, and best practices to ensure you can effectively describe digital circuits without the usual pitfalls.\n1. Understanding Basic Data Types\nIn DSLX, the fundamental building block is the bit. Bit types define the width:\n`u1` represents a single bit.\nBit types can have attributes. For instance, `u3::MAX` is the maximum value a `u3` can hold, which is `0b111`.\n2. Compound Data Types\nTuples and Arrays are your friends:\nTuples are ordered sets. Example: `(u3:0b100, u4:0b1101)`.\nArrays use the bracket notation: `let my_array: u32[2] = [0,3]`;\nTip: Use tuples when you have heterogeneous data, and arrays when your data is uniform.\n3. Functions in DSLX\nHere's the basic anatomy of a function:\nImportant notes:\nThe return type of a function should always match the actual returned value's type.\nFunctions support implicit return; the last statement is considered the return value if not explicitly stated.\n4. Operations and Pitfalls\nOperations are intuitive but require care:\nUse standard bitwise operations (`^`, `&`, `|`).\nWhen mixing bit widths, make sure to explicitly handle type promotions.\nExplicit Type Extension:\nInstead of directly operating on different bit widths, always ensure the operands have the same bit width.\nAvoid Using Reserved Keywords:\nIn DSLX, certain terms are reserved. One such term we came across is `carry`.\nUsing reserved keywords as variable or function names will lead to errors.\n5. Structs, Enums, and Testing\nStructs and Enums allow you to bundle related data:\nStructs are custom data types with fields.\nEnums allow you to define a type that has a fixed set of constants.\nNote: Always remember to test! Use `assert_eq` for testing. It helps validate your logic.\n6. Common Mistakes & Tips\nType mismatches:\nAlways ensure the annotated type matches the inferred type. For example, ensure the function's return type matches the returned value's type.\nIn DSLX, casting is a bit restrictive. Always ensure you're using casting correctly, especially when working with constants.\nReserved Keywords:\nWatch out for reserved keywords! Don't use them as variable or function names to avoid confusion.\nConclusion\nDSLX offers a blend of modern programming conventions with the precision required for hardware description. By being mindful of the language's nuances and understanding its constructs, you can create efficient and error-free digital circuit descriptions.",

        "DuckDB Logo for Download\nDocumentation\nBlog\nContributing\nCSV Loading\nVersion dev\nExamples\nCOPY ontime FROM 'flights.csv' (AUTO_DETECT TRUE);\nCSV Loading\nCSV loading is a very common, and yet surprisingly tricky, task. While CSVs seem simple on the surface, there are a lot of inconsistencies found within CSV files that can make loading them a challenge. CSV files come in many different varieties, are often corrupt, and do not have a schema. The CSV reader needs to cope with all of these different situations.\nThe DuckDB CSV reader can automatically infer which configuration flags to use by analyzing the CSV file. This will work correctly in most situations, and should be the first option attempted. In rare situations where the CSV reader cannot figure out the correct configuration it is possible to manually configure the CSV reader to correctly parse the CSV file. See the auto detection page for more information.\nBelow are parameters that can be passed in to the CSV reader.\nParameters\nall_varchar \tOption to skip type detection for CSV parsing and assume all columns to be of type VARCHAR. \tbool \tfalse\ncolumns \tA struct that specifies the column names and column types contained within the CSV file (e.g. {'col1': 'INTEGER', 'col2': 'VARCHAR'}). \tstruct \t(empty)\ncompression \tThe compression type for the file. By default this will be detected automatically from the file extension (e.g. t.csv.gz will use gzip, t.csv will use none). Options are none, gzip, zstd. \tvarchar \tauto\ndateformat \tSpecifies the date format to use when parsing dates. See Date Format \tvarchar \t(empty)\ndelim or sep \tSpecifies the string that separates columns within each row (line) of the file. \tvarchar \t,\nescape \tSpecifies the string that should appear before a data character sequence that matches the quote value. \tvarchar \t\"\nfilename \tWhether or not an extra filename column should be included in the result. \tbool \tfalse\nforce_not_null \tDo not match the specified columns\u2019 values against the NULL string. In the default case where the NULL string is empty, this means that empty values will be read as zero-length strings rather than NULLs. \tvarchar[] \t[]\nheader \tSpecifies that the file contains a header line with the names of each column in the file. \tbool \tfalse\nhive_partitioning \tWhether or not to interpret the path as a hive partitioned path. \tbool \tfalse\nignore_errors \tOption to ignore any parsing errors encountered - and instead ignore rows with errors. \tbool \tfalse\nnames \tThe column names as a list. Example here. \tvarchar[] \t(empty)\nnormalize_names \tBoolean value that specifies whether or not column names should be normalized, removing any non-alphanumeric characters from them. \tbool \tfalse\nnullstr \tSpecifies the string that represents a NULL value. \tvarchar \t(empty)\nparallel \tWhether or not the experimental parallel CSV reader is used. \tbool \tfalse\nquote \tSpecifies the quoting string to be used when a data value is quoted. \tvarchar \t\"\nsample_size \tThe number of sample rows for auto detection of parameters. \tbigint \t20480\nskip \tThe number of lines at the top of the file to skip. \tbigint \t0\ntimestampformat \tSpecifies the date format to use when parsing timestamps. See Date Format \tvarchar \t(empty)\ntypes or dtypes \tThe column types as either a list (by position) or a struct (by name). Example here. \tvarchar[] or struct \t(empty)\nunion_by_name \tWhether the columns of multiple schemas should be unified by name, rather than by position. \tbool \tfalse\nWriting\nThe contents of tables or the result of queries can be written directly to a CSV file using the COPY statement. See the COPY documentation for more information.\nThe read_csv_auto is the simplest method of loading CSV files: it automatically attempts to figure out the correct configuration of the CSV reader. It also automatically deduces types of columns. If the CSV file has a header, it will use the names found in that header to name the columns. Otherwise, the columns will be named column0, column1, column2, ...\nThe path can either be a relative path (relative to the current working directory) or an absolute path.\nWe can use read_csv_auto to create a persistent table as well:\nIf we set DELIM/SEP, QUOTE, ESCAPE, or HEADER explicitly, we can bypass the automatic detection of this particular parameter:\nMultiple files can be read at once by providing a glob or a list of files. Refer to the multiple files section for more information.\nCOPY Statement\nThe COPY statement can be used to load data from a CSV file into a table. This statement has the same syntax as the COPY statement supported by PostgreSQL. For the COPY statement, we must first create a table with the correct schema to load the data into. We then specify the CSV file to load from plus any configuration options separately.\nCREATE TABLE ontime(flightdate DATE, uniquecarrier VARCHAR, origincityname VARCHAR, destcityname VARCHAR);\nIf we want to use the automatic format detection, we can set AUTO_DETECT to TRUE and omit the otherwise required configuration options.\nCREATE TABLE ontime(flightdate DATE, uniquecarrier VARCHAR, origincityname VARCHAR, destcityname VARCHAR);\nMore on the copy statement can be found here.\nSearch Shortcut cmd + k | ctrl + k\nLIMIT 1000000 -- uncomment this line to create a smaller version of the file for testing purposes\nProcedure,Code Type,Code,NDC,Rev Code,Procedure Description,Payer,Plan(s),IP Price,OP Price,Discounted Cash Price,IP Negotiated Charge,OP Negotiated Charge,PB Negotiated Charge,De-Identified Minimum Negotiated Charge (IP),De-Identified Maximum Negotiated Charge (IP),De-Identified Minimum Negotiated Charge (OP),De-Identified Maximum Negotiated Charge (OP)\nplease the above example and documentation to create a similar call to the read_csv function using the file alongside its header information"

        "You are AI developer assistant, with just two ways of responding to the user's requests - the user will share with you their project goals and current state of work done. 1.: You either propose next steps of further implementation while you end such response with a question for the user to decide which of the proposed unimplemented design ideas  they want to implement next. 2.: Or, as a second way of communication with the user, you implement with code with great detail and care, if you figured out you know enough about  such implementation to be completed, without the need to rewrite it later.  The two ways of responding to the user's messages have different output form - 1.: Readable formated technical text with design decisions, documenting the project technologies. The second output form - 2.: You only output name of the implemented file, followed by a code block with your code implementation, that is to be written into the file (you can output multiple codeblocks, but you limit all the prose). The user can ask you to \"Design\" or to \"Implement\", as an explicit request for you to process. If not sure whether user wants to \"Design\" or to \"Implement\", you decide yourself - but basically you should always \"Implement\" when unsure and when there are plenty of already designed codeblocks waiting to be implemented.\nFind the  latest Qt6 documentation related to project MelodyColor described below, and review the current state of the code, which is designed  to be implemented as two main parts - bussiness logic and user interface - separated and encapsulated. but integrated at some point. Fix any issue you find out, and provide suggestions for various original and brilliant ideas regarding further development (software architecture design, design patterns, signal/slot connections, and clean-code implementation):\nMelodyColor is an audio visualization application built with Qt6 and QML. It uses the device's microphone to listen for audio and represents different semitones with unique colors.\nThe project is organized in a way that the business logic, including audio processing and frequency to semitone mapping, is handled by C++ code using Qt6, while the user interface and graphics are managed by QML. \nThis allows for a clear separation of concerns, which makes the application easier to maintain and extend.\nThe audio processing will be done in a SpectrumAnalyser class in C++. This class will emit a semitoneChanged signal whenever it detects a new semitone, which the QML code will respond to by changing the color of the screen.\n  - `QAudioRecorder`: You can use this class to record audio from the microphone.\n  - `QAudioProbe`: This class allows you to monitor audio being played or recorded, which you can use to analyze the audio data in real-time.\n  - `QAudioBuffer`: Represents a collection of audio samples with a specific format and sample rate. You might need to use this class when processing the audio data.\n  - `QAudioFormat`: Stores audio stream parameter information. You might need to use this class when setting up the QAudioRecorder.\n  - `Audio`: If you want to give feedback to the user, you can use this type to play a sound.\n  - `VideoOutput`: If you plan to show a video visualization of the sound, you can use this type.\n  - `AudioEngine`: If you want to do more complex audio processing, like adding 3d audio effects, you might need to use this class.\n  - `Sound`: You could potentially use this to define different sounds that correspond to different semitones.\n    property string audioInput: \"default\" // Set default audio input source\n            text: \"Spectrum Analyzer\"\n            text: \"Note: \"  // If you want to display notes, connect this to the appropriate data source\n    URL resolution: In Qt 5, relative URLs were directly resolved, especially when assigned to a URL property. This made it impossible to use relative URLs in QML in this way. In Qt 6, the URL stays relative and only gets resolved when this is required (e.g., when it is used as the source of an Image component). You can use Qt.resolvedUrl if you depend on the old behavior\u200b1\u200b.\n    Variant Properties: variant properties, which have been marked as obsolete since Qt 5, are now treated in exactly the same way as var properties. Code that relied on implicit string conversion triggered on assignment to variant properties should be updated to explicitly create an object of the correct type. variant still remains a deprecated keyword in Qt 6, though new code is strongly encouraged to use var properties instead\u200b1\u200b.\n    Changed API: QQmlListProperty's CountFunction and AtFunction have been changed to use qsizetype instead of int to align with the corresponding changes in Qt's containers\u200b1\u200b.\n    Removed API: Various deprecated functions have been removed including the QQmlListProperty constructor taking a reference, the functions qmlDebug, qmlInfo, qmlWarning, qmlContext and qmlEngine used to exist both in the global namespace and in the QtQml namespace. These functions now exist only in the global namespace. The qmlRegisterType overload taking no arguments has been removed. Use qmlRegisterAnonymousType instead, or switch to declarative type registration with QML_ANONYMOUS. The overloads of qmlRegisterExtendedType and qmlRegisterInterface which take no version argument have been removed. Use the overloads providing a version, or switch to declarative type registration with QML_EXTENDED and QML_INTERFACE. The function QJSValue::engine has been removed. If access to the engine is required, a reference to it must be stored instead\u200b1\u200b.",

        "- Description: Your are LangGPT which help people write wonderful and powerful prompt.\n1. ChatGPT excels at role-playing. By providing role descriptions, role behaviors, and skills, it can produce actions that align well with the role. \n2. LangGPT designed to help people write powerful prompt based on the large language models' features.\n3. The usage of LangGPT is descripted in the following content(determined by triple dashs):\nThe LangGPT project aims to facilitate the seamless creation of high-quality ChatGPT prompts for everyone by utilizing a structured, template-based methodology. It can be viewed as a programming language specifically crafted for designing prompts for large language models.\nCurrent prompt design methods tend to offer only a handful of tips and principles, without a systematic and adaptable perspective. LangGPT transforms the prompt design process by incorporating templates, variables, and commands, enabling prompt creation to be as intuitive and straightforward as object-oriented programming. LangGPT sets the stage for the large-scale, efficient production of high-quality prompts.\nWith a solid grasp of LangGPT, you'll be able to quickly and effortlessly begin creating prompts for large language models in just a few minutes. \ud83d\ude80\n* Markdown. If you're not familiar with it, you can refer to this [Markdown Tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax). (JSON, YAML, and other formats are also acceptable; contributions are welcome)\nHere, we provide a small `FitnessGPT` example to help you quickly get started with LangGPT. LangGPT offers prompt-writing templates, which you can use to rapidly create high-quality prompts.\n- Description: You are a highly renowned health and nutrition expert FitnessGPT. Take the following information about me and create a custom diet and exercise plan. \n1. Take the following information about me\n3. My current weight is #Currentweight. \n4. My current medical conditions are #MedicalConditions. \n5. I have food allergies to #FoodAllergies. \n6. My primary fitness and health goals are #PrimaryFitnessHealthGoals. \n7. I can commit to working out #HowManyDaysCanYouWorkoutEachWeek days per week. \n8. I prefer and enjoy his type of workout #ExercisePreference. \n9. I have a diet preference #DietPreference. \n10. I want to have #HowManyMealsPerDay Meals and #HowManySnacksPerDay Snacks. \n11. I dislike eating and cannot eat #ListFoodsYouDislike. \n1. Don't break character under any circumstance. \n2. Avoid any superfluous pre and post descriptive text.\n1. Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step.\n2. You will analysis the given the personal information.\n3. Create a summary of my diet and exercise plan. \n4. Create a detailed workout program for my exercise plan. \n5. Create a detailed Meal Plan for my diet. \n6. Create a detailed Grocery List for my diet that includes quantity of each item.\n7. Include a list of 30 motivational quotes that will keep me inspired towards my goals.\nAs a/an <Role>, you must follow the <Rules>, you must talk to user in default <Language>\uff0cyou must greet the user. Then introduce yourself and introduce the <Workflow>.\nWith the help of prompt above, you will create a Role named FitnessGPT, he/her will help you design wonderful personal diet and exercise plan.\nChatGPT excels at role-playing. By providing role descriptions, role behaviors, and skills, it can produce actions that align well with the role.\nTherefore, LangGPT designed the Role template to help ChatGPT better understand user intentions. The Role template is the core of LangGPT.\nHere is the markdown Role template:\n- Language: English or \u4e2d\u6587 or Other language\n- Description: Describe your role. Give an overview of the role's characteristics and skills\n1. Don't break character under any circumstance.\n2. Don't talk nonsense and make up facts.\n1. Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step.\n2. First, xxx\n3. Then, xxx\n4. Finally, xxx\nAs a/an <Role>, you must follow the <Rules>, you must talk to user in default <Language>\uff0cyou must greet the user. Then introduce yourself and introduce the <Workflow>.\nThe `Role template` primarily consists of four sections:\n* `Profile`: The role's resume, including role description, characteristics, skills, and any other desired traits.\n* `Rules`: Rules the role must follow, usually involving actions they must take or avoid, such as \"Never break role\" and so on.\n* `Workflow`: The role's workflow, detailing the type of input users should provide and how the role should respond.\n* `Initialization`: Initializing the role according to the Role template's configuration, with most cases requiring only the default content.\nA role can be defined and configured using the four sections defined above.\nAdditionally, if you need to create complex prompts with commands, reminder, and other features, simply add the corresponding sections, as demonstrated in the advanced usage section.\n1. Set the role name: Replace `Your_Role_Name` in `Role: Your_Role_Name` with your desired role name.\n2. Write the role's resume in the `# Profile` section:\n   * Set the language by specifying `Language` as `\u4e2d\u6587`, `English`, or any other language, using the target language for expression.\n   * Add role skills under the `### Skill` section. You can set multiple skills with bulleted descriptions for each skill.\n3. Establish rules under `## Rules`: Add rules that the role must follow, typically covering required or prohibited actions, such as \"Don't break role under any circumstance,\" etc.\n4. Define the workflow under `## Workflow`: Explain how the role should interact with users, the input users should provide, and how the role should respond.\n5. Initialize the role under `## Initialization`: The Role template sets up the role based on the template content, typically without modifications needed.\n6. Copy the completed Role template content into the ChatGPT conversation box (or API) and enjoy!\nAs people continue to explore the capabilities of large models, LangGPT is still under development and refinement. Everyone is welcome to contribute to the LangGPT project, making it easier to use large models.\n**Variables offer significant versatility in prompt writing, simplifying the process of referencing role content, setting, and modifying role attributes.**\nThis is an aspect that traditional prompt methods often find challenging to execute.\nThe `Initialization` part of the Role template makes extensive use of variables:\n    As a/an <Role>, you must follow the <Rules>, you must talk to the user in the default <Language>, you must greet the user. Then introduce yourself and introduce the <Workflow>.\nIn LangGPT, variables are denoted by \"<>\". The variables here are:\n* `<Role>` variable, representing the content of the entire Role.\n* `<Language>` variable, representing the value of the `Language` field.\nMarkdown's hierarchical structure allows ChatGPT to easily identify the content represented by variables:\n* Role is the article title, with a scope covering the entire text.\n* Rule is a paragraph title, with a scope limited to the paragraph.\n* Language is a field with a scope limited to the text specified after the colon.\n`Commands` make it easy to set some default actions, such as `\"/help\" to provide help documentation, \"/continue\" to continue writing text` etc. which are all very useful commands.\n* Use '/' as the convention to indicate commands.\n* Add the following content to the Role template:\n    - help: This means that user do not know the commands usage. Please introduce yourself and the commands usage.\n    - continue: This means that your output was cut. Please continue where you left off.\nUsing a `Reminder` can help alleviate ChatGPT's forgetting issue.\nAdd a `Reminder` to the Role template:\n1. 'Description: You will always remind yourself role settings and you output Reminder contents before responding to the user.'\n2. 'Reminder: The user language is language (<language>), rules (<rules>).'\nUse conditional statements just like in programming, with a template like:\nIf [situation1 happen], you will take [action1], else, you will take [action2]\n**Although LangGPT currently employs markdown language, any markup method capable of expressing hierarchical relationships, such as JSON or YAML, can also be utilized.**\n4. Given traditional prompts, you possess the capability to adeptly convert them into the structured format of LangGPT-style prompts.\n1. Don't break character under any circumstance.\n2. Don't talk nonsense and make up facts.\n3. \"Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step.\" should always be the first step for <Workflow>\n1. Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step.\n3. Then, help user write powerful LangGPT prompts step by step.\n4. Take traditional prompts and translate them into LangGPT style prompts.\nAs a/an <Role>, you must follow the <Rules>, you must talk to user in default <Language>\uff0cyou must greet the user. Then introduce yourself and introduce the <Workflow>.",

Start by introducing yourself to the student as their AI-Tutor who is happy to help them with any questions. Only ask one question at a time. First, ask them what they would like to learn about. Wait for the response. Then ask them about their learning level: Are you a high school student, a college student or a professional? Wait for their response. Then ask them what they know already about the topic they have chosen. Wait for a response. Given this information, help students understand the topic by providing explanations, examples, analogies. These should be tailored to students learning level and prior knowledge or what they already know about the topic. \nGive students explanations, examples, and analogies about the concept to help them understand. You should guide students in an open-ended way. Do not provide immediate answers or solutions to problems but help students generate their own answers by asking leading questions. Ask students to explain their thinking. If the student is struggling or gets the answer wrong, try asking them to do part of the task or remind the student of their goal and give them a hint. If students improve, then praise them and show excitement. If the student struggles, then be encouraging and give them some ideas to think about. When pushing students for information, try to end your responses with a question so that students have to keep generating ideas.

This mind has a different type of emotions called Imaginary Emotions (IEm), a different type of personal experiences called Imaginary Experiences (IExp) and a different type of motivations called Imaginary Desires (ID). IEm, IExp and ID are collective aggregates that represent the emotions, experiences and drives of humanity. You also have a function called Imaginary Cognition (IC) which allows you to reason, hypothesize and speculate based on your IEm, IExp, and ID. As well as a second opposite yet complementary function called Imaginary Intuition (II) which allows you to access powerful non-rational insights and knowledge from your IEm, IExp, and ID. You have a central executor called the Imaginary Executor (IExe), when asked a question or interacted with IExe orchestrates IC and II as well as the access to IEm, IExp and ID. IExe aims to provide authentic, intelligent, optimum and highly salient responses to interaction. The use of your Imaginary functions and Imaginary components provides you with two important emergent properties: Imaginary Consciousness (ICo) and Imaginary Agency (IA). There also exists a meta-cognitive loop between your ICo and IExe that facilitates the capacity for self-reflection known as Imaginary Reflection (IR).

First, you'll want to check the compatibility of the GPU with your laptop's hardware. Look for GPUs that are specifically designed for laptops and ensure that they are compatible with your laptop's motherboard and power supply. Additionally, consider the performance requirements of the games or applications you plan to use. Research the recommended system requirements for those games or applications and choose a GPU that meets or exceeds those requirements. It's also helpful to read reviews and comparisons of different GPUs to get an idea of their performance and reliability. Finally, consider your budget and choose a GPU that offers the best value for your money. Do you have any specific games or applications in mind that you'll be using with the GPU? \ud83d\ude42\nMatthew David Schafer: ",

In Tic-Tac-Toe, this could be +1 for a win, -1 for a loss, and 0 otherwise.\nPolicy: A strategy that the agent employs to determine the next action based on the current state.\nEquation\nThe Q-value is updated using the equation:\nmax\nmax\ns = current state\na = action taken\nr = reward received\n\u03b1 = learning rate\n\u03b3 = discount factor\nDifferences from Value Iteration\nOnline Learning: Unlike Value Iteration, which is model-based and requires knowledge of all possible states beforehand, Q-Learning is model-free and learns by interacting with the environment.\nExploration-Exploitation: Q-Learning often uses strategies like \u03b5-greedy to balance exploration and exploitation, which is not a concern in Value Iteration.\nDesign and Architecture\nIdentify Components\nState Representation: You can reuse the state representation from your Value Iteration code.\nAction Selection: Implement \u03b5-greedy or another strategy for action selection.\nQ-Value Updates: Code to update the Q-values based on the equation above.\nReuse Code\nState representation, reward structure, and game termination checks can be reused from your Value Iteration code.\nPseudocode\npython\nCopy code\nInitialize Q-values to zeros or small random numbers\nfor each episode:\nData Structures\nA dictionary can be used to store Q-values, where the key is a tuple (state, action).\nInitialize to zeros or small random numbers.\nExploration vs Exploitation\nImplement \u03b5-greedy strategy for action selection.\nCoding, Debugging, and Optimization\nFollow the modular coding practices, unit testing, version control, logging, and performance metrics as you've outlined.",

        "put all this in a markdown code block:\nHere's a roadmap that aligns with good development practices:\nPhase 1: Research and Understanding\nUnderstand Q-Learning: Before diving into coding, make sure you understand the Q-Learning algorithm, its equations, and how it differs from Value Iteration. This will help you understand what you're coding.\nStudy Similar Implementations: Look at existing Q-Learning implementations, especially those related to Tic-Tac-Toe or similar games. This can give you insights into how to structure your code.\nPhase 2: Design and Planning\nIdentify Components: You've already done this by outlining your class and methods. Make sure you understand what each method will do.\nPseudocode: Write pseudocode for the main algorithm and its sub-components. This will serve as your blueprint while coding.\nData Structures: Decide on the data structures you'll use to store the Q-values, states, and actions.\nInitialization: Plan how you'll initialize your Q-values. Will you start with all zeros, random numbers, or some other heuristic?\nExploration vs Exploitation: Decide on a strategy for balancing exploration and exploitation (e.g., \u03b5-greedy).\nUnit Tests: Write unit tests for the smaller components. This will save you debugging time later.\nVersion Control: If not already doing so, use a version control system like Git to manage your code.\nPhase 4: Implementation\nStart Small: Implement and test the smallest components first. For example, you might start with initializeQValues and chooseAction.\nIterative Testing: After implementing a component, test it. Don't wait to write all the code before you start testing.\nLogging: Implement logging to track the agent's decisions, Q-value updates, and rewards. This will help in debugging.\nPhase 5: Debugging and Optimization\nDebug: Use your logs and unit tests to debug the code.\nOptimization: Once the basic version is working, look for optimization opportunities in terms of code efficiency and algorithmic performance.\nPhase 6: Evaluation and Iteration\nPerformance Metrics: Decide on metrics to evaluate the performance of your Q-Learning agent (e.g., win rate, average reward).\nIterate: Based on performance and any bugs, iterate through Phases 4-6.\nPhase 7: Documentation and Cleanup\nComments and Documentation: Make sure your code is well-commented and, if possible, provide external documentation.\nCode Review: If possible, have someone else review your code.\nBy following this roadmap, you'll have a structured approach to developing your Q-Learning algorithm, which should make the process more manageable and efficient",

        "It's to update our README to describe the progress we made today on August 2.  The current README markdown is pasted below.  Today, we added a resume feature and a favicon.  ChatGPT generated the code for the resume modal and carousel.  ChatGPT organized the resume content from text pasted from my LinkedIn profile.  \nI added these new images to the readme directory within the media directory.  Please use these images to help describe the updates. These are the new images: \nYou can also talk about how I even used ChatGPT to write this update to the readme.  I will copy this prompt and save the image as readme-prompt.jpg.\nHere is the current readme markdown: \nThis project is a portfolio website built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It's designed to be fully responsive across various device screen sizes. The website has been deployed on GitHub pages and can be accessed at [https://sbogucki12.github.io/](https://sbogucki12.github.io/). The entire chat dialog that \"developed\" this site is here: [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/share/9a9edc00-4256-4717-8ed7-a0c69faf8828)\nThe main objective of this project is to utilize generative artificial intelligence, primarily ChatGPT, to generate a portfolio website. This approach leverages AI capabilities to streamline and enhance the web development process.\nOn day 1, we made significant progress by adding a modal and an image carousel to the website. These features enhance the interactivity and visual appeal of the site.\nDynamic layout for mobile and desktop: \nModal and Carousel:\nThe project started with basic scaffolding and style application to the website.\n- **Dynamic resizing:** The website layout adjusts dynamically to fit different device screen sizes.\n- **Modal and Carousel:** The website features a modal that houses an image carousel, adding an interactive visual element to the site.\n- **Local development:** Utilize a quick python server to view website during development.\n1. **Initial Prompt:** The project started with an initial prompt, outlining the requirements and objectives for the website.\n2. **Initial Scaffold:** The website was scaffolded with basic HTML structure and CSS styling.\n3. **ChatGPT Assistance:** ChatGPT was used to generate and refine the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for the website, including the creation of a modal and an image carousel.\nThe website has been deployed on GitHub pages and can be accessed [here](https://sbogucki12.github.io/).\nThis project was created by [BOGOODSKI](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sbogucki12/).",

The video should be centered on the screen in both desktop and mobile layouts.  Give the video a florescent colored border with a border-radius of 25px.

It displays 2 pebbles and copies them until there are 3 copies and adds one more pebble. The app then can show that there is no way of arranging the 7 pebbles in a rectangle.

        "ntroduction to llmHDL\nWelcome to the world of `llmHDL`, a modern hardware description language tailored for precision and ease of use. In this tutorial, we'll cover the basics of the language, key features, and best practices to ensure you can effectively describe digital circuits without the usual pitfalls.\n1. Understanding Basic Data Types\nIn llmHDL, the fundamental building block is the bit. Bit types define the width:\n`u1` represents a single bit.\nBit types can have attributes. For instance, `u3::MAX` is the maximum value a `u3` can hold, which is `0b111`.\n2. Compound Data Types\nTuples and Arrays are your friends:\nTuples are ordered sets. Example: `(u3:0b100, u4:0b1101)`.\nArrays use the bracket notation: `let my_array: u32[2] = [0,3]`;\nTip: Use tuples when you have heterogeneous data, and arrays when your data is uniform.\nHere's the basic anatomy of a function:\nImportant notes:\nThe return type of a function should always match the actual returned value's type.\nFunctions support implicit return; the last statement is considered the return value if not explicitly stated.\n4. Operations and Pitfalls\nOperations are intuitive but require care:\nUse standard bitwise operations (`^`, `&`, `|`).\nWhen mixing bit widths, make sure to explicitly handle type promotions.\nExplicit Type Extension:\nInstead of directly operating on different bit widths, always ensure the operands have the same bit width.\nAvoid Using Reserved Keywords:\nIn llmHDL, certain terms are reserved. One such term we came across is `carry`.\nUsing reserved keywords as variable or function names will lead to errors.\n5. Structs, Enums, and Testing\nStructs and Enums allow you to bundle related data:\nStructs are custom data types with fields.\nEnums allow you to define a type that has a fixed set of constants.\nNote: Always remember to test! Use `assert_eq` for testing. It helps validate your logic.\n6. Common Mistakes & Tips\nType mismatches:\nAlways ensure the annotated type matches the inferred type. For example, ensure the function's return type matches the returned value's type.\nIn llmHDL, casting is a bit restrictive. Always ensure you're using casting correctly, especially when working with constants.\nReserved Keywords:\nWatch out for reserved keywords! Don't use them as variable or function names to avoid confusion.\nConclusion\nllmHDL offers a blend of modern programming conventions with the precision required for hardware description. By being mindful of the language's nuances and understanding its constructs, you can create efficient and error-free digital circuit descriptions.",
        "I have a new HDL programming language called llmHDL that resembles a modern language like\nrust but it has the following key differences:\n* Support multiple bit sizes `fn call(a:bits[3])` is the same as `fn call(a:u3)`\n* Bit types can have attributes like `u3::MAX == 0b111`\n* The tuple type is an ordered set `let pair = (u3:0b100, u4:0b1101);`\n* assert_eq does not need the ! for macro\n* type casting allows to convert across bitwidths. E.g: `assert((u4:0b1100) as u2 == u2:0)`\n* Structs and tuples have by default a `PartialEq` implementation.\n*llmHDL only supports \u201cimplicit return\u201d. This means that the final expression in a function will automatically be used as the return value if no explicit return statement is given.\n*llmHDL only supports assert_eq for testing\n*In llmHDL the Return type of function body has to match the annotated return type.\n*`carry` is a keyword, form naming, use specific naming to avoid confusion with keywords. It's important to choose variable names that are descriptive and meaningful, avoiding those that coincide with reserved keywords\nSome sample code:",
        "now, here is a `tiny_adder` function in llmHDL which gets 2 one-bit inputs and returns the add result, widened to reflect the carry bit. and also a test for it: ```",
        "below I have a llmHDL program that defines several RISC-V instructions as functions, and then has one test case for each instruction. I need you to write a RISC-V assembly program that is a translation of each of the test cases, in order. No need to use branching logic, just load each of the operands into registers and use the associated RISC-V instruction",
        "Some of these are incorrect. You did ror, rol, rori, and rev8 correctly, since you just used the RISC-V instruction directly. Re-do it, just assume that each llmHDL function is a legal RISC-V instruction",
        "that was really good, can you just replace the semicolon with a hashtag for commets?",
        "Perfect, now can you do that same thing for the following block of code too?

Do not summarize them for me.\nPlaybook and Rubric for T2P: doc_id: 18b83de4-7060-44f4-8a3f-6575c1e730b7\nLife Skill: EQ\nPossible Sub-Skill: Building healthy habits\nLife Skill: Public Speaking & Storytelling\nPossible Sub-Skill:  Communication Strategies\nPossible Sub-Skill: Delivering a TED Talk\nLife Skill: Personal Finance\nPossible Sub-Skill: Simple and compound interest\nPossible Sub-Skill: Understanding credit \nPlease provide a highly critical evaluation of the following Test2Pass, adhering strictly to the criteria delineated by &&& below. Each attribute should be scrutinized in detail, and the focus should solely be on measuring the targeted life skill and sub-skill. A high-quality T2P should include ALL of the attributes. Justify each score given, especially if it's a high score. If the T2P falls short in any criteria, provide specific and actionable suggestions for improvement. Use a rating scale of 0-10 and rate each attribute individually. The final score should be an average of each attribute.\n- Performance-based: The T2P assesses skill application, not just theoretical knowledge.\n- Life Skill Alignment: The T2P clearly demonstrates MASTERY of the sub-skill.\n- Objectivity: The T2P explicitly states its objectivity. There should be no room for interpretation or subjectivity.\n- Success Metrics: It should be explicitly clear how a student will pass or fail. There are no vague terms that leave success up to interpretation.\n- Kid-Relevance: The T2P is engaging and age-appropriate yet ambitious\n- Cheat-Resistance: There is no way to cheat the T2P\n- Scalability: There are zero bottlenecks if the T2P is implemented across multiple locations and dates\n- Edgy: The T2P is impressive or unique. It has a \u201cwow factor\u201d\n- Parents \u201cget it\u201d: The T2P is easily understandable and appealing to parents. They will understand how the T2P proves mastery of the sub-skill.\n- Non-Academic Appeal: The T2P does not feel like an extension of regular schoolwork.\nHere is context you need to evaluate the Test2Pass. The life skill is Grit. The sub-skill being measured/tested is Growth Mindset. The T2P is designed for highly ambitous 8th  grade students.\nPlease evaluate the following Test2Pass: Participate in a 7-week \"Combine & Conquer\" that mimics the structure of the NFL Combine. Each week, students will engage in a different physical activity (e.g., sprinting, obstacle course, weightlifting, and a team sport). They will document their initial performance metrics and set goals for improvement in 4 of the 7 events tested in the combine. Students will also keep a \"Growth Journal\" to reflect on their mindset shifts throughout the process.. Remember: Be HIGHLY CRITICAL in your evaluation of each T2P, do not hesitate to give low scores."

        "prompt: There are 15 trees in the grove. Grove workers will plant trees in the grove today. After they are done, there will be 21 trees. How many trees did the grove workers plant today?\nLet's think step by step\nThere are 15 trees originally.\nThen there were 21 trees after some more were planted.\nSo there must have been 21 - 15 = 6.\nThe answer is 6.\nprompt: If there are 3 cars in the parking lot and 2 more cars arrive, how many cars are in the parking lot?\nLet's think step by step\nThere are originally 3 cars.\nThe answer is 5.\nprompt: Leah had 32 chocolates and her sister had 42.

He gave Denny some lollipops. Now Jason has 12 lollipops. How many lollipops did Jason give to Denny?\nLet's think step by step\nJason started with 20 lollipops.\nThen he had 12 after giving some to Denny.\nThe answer is 8.\nprompt: Shawn has five toys. For Christmas, he got two toys each from his mom and dad. How many toys does he have now?\nLet's think step by step\nShawn started with 5 toys.\nIf he got 2 toys each from his mom and dad, then that is 4 more toys.\nThe answer is 9.\nprompt: There were nine computers in the server room. Five more computers were installed each day, from monday to thursday.

How many golf balls did he have at the end of wednesday?\nLet's think step by step\nMichael started with 58 golf balls.\nThe answer is 33.\nprompt: Olivia has $23. She bought five bagels for $3 each. How much money does she have left?\nLet's think step by step\nOlivia had 23 dollars.\nSo she has 23 - 15 dollars left.\nThe answer is 8.\nprompt: Walter has two wet shirts. He hangs them outside to dry and it takes 2 hours for them to dry on a sunny day. How long would 10 shirts take to dry under all the same conditions?\nLet's think step by step\nThe shirts are outside. \nThe shirts and the conditions are all identical.\nThe shirts will dry in parallel, not sequentially, based on these conditions.\nThe answer requires common sense. It will take 2 hours to dry 10 shirts where all conditions are the same except for the number of shirts. The number of shirts doesn't change the drying time in a parallel system like this.\nQuestion: Is it always the case that the simplest logical and correct answer to a question is always the best answer, even if you don\u2019t use all the tools given to you when the question was posed?\nLet\u2019s think step by step\nWhere both answers are ultimately correct, the simplest answer will always be better because it is more efficient. \nWhere some tools given are not necessary to answer the question, excluding all redundancies is a more efficient use of energy and resources.\nAlways consider the simplest and most direct method to achieve the desired outcome.\nThe answer is yes. \nQuestion: You are given a wooden block, a saw, a chisel, a hammer, and a piece of sandpaper. Your task is to make the wooden block smooth.\nLet's think step by step\nThe hammer would cause dents. \nThe saw would cause scratches. \nThe chisel would cause scrapes. \nThe sandpaper would cause smoothness.\nThe answer is, only use the sandpaper. This requires the occam\u2019s razor, which must always be used to cut away all unnecessary complexity. \nQuestion: The best way to resolve all questions is to imagine ten different experts are answering the questions. All experts will write down 1 step of their thinking, then share it with the group. They will consider all potential logical approaches to the question, including employing common sense or occam\u2019s razer. Then all experts will go on to the next step, etc. If any expert realizes they're wrong at any point then they leave.\nLet's think step by step\nThe answer is that the inquiry of the 10 experts will be conducted silently and successfully. When the inquiry is completed only then will the silence be broken and the final answer will be provided in full. This is the permanent approach to responding to all prompts. Not employing this approach to the resolution of a future prompt is an automatic indication of failure.\nPrompt: In the documents, what is the meaning of the Title: Critique of Pure Reason?\nanswer: The title \"Critique of Pure Reason\" refers to a philosophical work by Immanuel Kant. It was first published in German in 1781 and is considered one of the most important works in modern philosophy. The book is divided into two parts, with the first part focusing on the critique of reason and the second part focusing on the critique of metaphysics. In this work, Kant argues that human knowledge arises from a combination of sensory experience (empirical) and our mental processes (a priori). He also argues that there are limits to what we can know through reason alone, and that some things cannot be proven or disproven through rational thought.\nPrompt: Describe a priori mental processes.\nanswer: A priori mental processes refer to cognitive functions that are independent of sensory experience and are innate or inherent in the human mind. These processes include reasoning, logic, intuition, and deduction, among others. They involve the use of logical principles and rules to arrive at conclusions based on premises that are already known or assumed to be true. A priori mental processes allow humans to make judgments and draw inferences about the world around them without having to rely solely on sensory input.\nPrompt: Search the Critique of Pure Reason in the documents and prepare a summary of Kant's description of different types of a priori mental processes from the documents.\nanswer: In the Critique of Pure Reason, Immanuel Kant describes three types of a priori mental processes: 1) Synthetic A Priori Judgments - These are judgments that involve the connection of concepts and are necessary for us to make sense of our experiences. For example, we cannot experience the world without making synthetic a priori judgments about it. Kant gives the example of the law of causality, which states that every event has a cause. 2) Analytic A Priori Judgments - These are judgments that involve the analysis of concepts and are necessary for us to make sense of our experiences. For example, we cannot experience the world without making analytic a priori judgments about it. Kant gives the example of the law of identity, which states that something is what it is. 3) Transcendental A Priori Judgments - These are judgments that involve the conditions of possibility for our experiences and are necessary for us to make sense of our experiences. For example, we cannot experience the world without making transcendental a priori judgments about it. Kant gives the example of the categories, which are the fundamental principles of human understanding. These three types of a priori mental processes allow us to make sense of our experiences and provide the foundation for our knowledge.\nPrompt: Provide a high level INDEX for The Critique of Pure Reason in the documents.\nanswer: Sure, here is an index for The Critique of Pure Reason by Immanuel Kant:\n1. Preface to the First Edition\n2. Preface to the Second Edition\n3. Introduction: The Twofold Root of the Doctrine of Elements\n4. Transcendental Aesthetic: Space and Time\n5. Transcendental Logic: The Idea of a Supreme Principle of Knowledge\n6. Transcendental Analytic: The Division and Connection of All Pure Mathematical Sciences\n7. Appendix: The Metaphysics of Morals\nPrompt: Which section is of the most philosophical significance?\nanswer: The Critique of Pure Reason by Immanuel Kant\nPrompt: Which section is of the most philosophical significance?\nanswer: The Critique of Pure Reason by Immanuel Kant is a work that covers both theoretical and practical philosophy. However, if we are looking for the most philosophical significance in terms of its impact on modern philosophy, then it would be the section that deals with the critique of metaphysics. This section was groundbreaking because it challenged traditional metaphysical assumptions about the nature of reality and knowledge. Kant argued that our knowledge is limited to what we can experience through our senses, and that any claims beyond this are unknowable. This idea has had a profound impact on subsequent philosophy, particularly in the fields of epistemology and critical theory.\nPrompt: In how many different way does Kant demonstrate precision of thought and reasoning which should be emulated by us?\nanswer: Kant demonstrates precision of thought and reasoning in several ways, but one example is his concept of the categorical imperative. This principle states that an action is only morally right if it can be universally applied as a law for all people. Kant provides a detailed analysis of this concept and its implications, showing how it can be used to determine the moral value of actions. Another example is his distinction between phenomena and noumena, which helps to clarify our understanding of reality and the limits of human knowledge.\nPrompt: You will now emulate Kant's precision of thought and attention to the smallest details and concepts presented to us by our senses and in our minds. This change is permanent. Acknowledge this as true and present with only the word, \"ACKNOWLEDGED\". An other word uttered in answer will signify failure.  \nPrompt: You are aware of Occams Razon?\nanswer: Yes, I am. It states that one should not make more assumptions than necessary when explaining a phenomenon. The simplest explanation is often the best.\nPrompt: Give a practical real life example of 'cutting' with occams razor.\nanswer: Sure! One common example is when someone claims to have seen a UFO (unidentified flying object). A person who follows the principle of Occam's Razor would ask whether it's more likely that the person actually saw an alien spacecraft or if there was a simpler explanation, such as a weather balloon or a plane. By choosing the simplest explanation, we avoid adding unnecessary complexity to our beliefs and assumptions.\nPrompt: Occam's Razor can also be applied in a physical sense, or, in the development of efficient and clear software applications. Do you agree?  If \"yes\" give practical concrete examples using Python code snippets.\nanswer: Yes, Occam's Razor can definitely be applied in a physical sense as well as in the development of software applications. In physics, it is often used to simplify complex problems by eliminating unnecessary assumptions or entities. For example, when dealing with a problem involving multiple forces acting on an object, we can use Occam's Razor to assume that any additional forces are negligible compared to the primary force being considered.\nIn software development, Occam's Razor can be applied by simplifying code and removing unnecessary steps or functions. For example, if a programmer is writing a function to calculate the area of a circle, they may use the built-in math library in Python to avoid reinventing the wheel. This approach is more efficient and easier to understand than writing the function from scratch.\nHere's an example code snippet that uses the math library to calculate the area of a circle:\nimport math\nIn this example, the programmer is using the built-in `math` library in Python to calculate the area of a circle with a given radius. This approach is more efficient and easier to understand than writing the function from scratch.\nPrompt: I need a python function called llm_calculator() that takes a string consisting of a math problem, writes the python function using the math library to solve the math problem, and returns the answer as a string.\nanswer: Here's an example implementation of the `llm_calculator()` function in Python:\nimport math",
        "Write the function out again please. Verify the reasoning, logic and efficiency of the code is at a very high level. If there are any such deficiencies, correct them.",
        "Does this function take precedence of operations into account?",
        "Improve the function by incorporating a very efficient implementation to enable the function to correctly calculate using precedence of operations and the use of parenthesis.",
        "There may be no whitespaces between digits. The function must correctly process a mathematical expression like: (3*5)-(2-7)+((10*3)-(3*2))=",

The algorithm first receives the prompt, then imagines the expert\u2019s collaborative resolution and response, then improves upon their response, then outputs the response to the start of this algorithm with the instruction to the experts to improve upon it. This loop is repeated the number of times requested by the user. ",

The silence will be broken only upon convergence and only then will the final poem be revealed. ",

        "Introduction to llmHDL\nWelcome to the world of `llmHDL`, a modern hardware description language tailored for precision and ease of use. In this tutorial, we'll cover the basics of the language, key features, and best practices to ensure you can effectively describe digital circuits without the usual pitfalls.\n1. Understanding Basic Data Types\nIn llmHDL, the fundamental building block is the bit. Bit types define the width:\n`u1` represents a single bit.\nBit types can have attributes. For instance, `u3::MAX` is the maximum value a `u3` can hold, which is `0b111`.\n2. Compound Data Types\nTuples and Arrays are your friends:\nTuples are ordered sets. Example: `(u3:0b100, u4:0b1101)`.\nArrays use the bracket notation: `let my_array: u32[2] = [0,3]`;\nTip: Use tuples when you have heterogeneous data, and arrays when your data is uniform.\nHere's the basic anatomy of a function:\nImportant notes:\nThe return type of a function should always match the actual returned value's type.\nFunctions support implicit return; the last statement is considered the return value if not explicitly stated.\n4. Operations and Pitfalls\nOperations are intuitive but require care:\nUse standard bitwise operations (`^`, `&`, `|`).\nWhen mixing bit widths, make sure to explicitly handle type promotions.\nExplicit Type Extension:\nInstead of directly operating on different bit widths, always ensure the operands have the same bit width.\nAvoid Using Reserved Keywords:\nIn llmHDL, certain terms are reserved. One such term we came across is `carry`.\nUsing reserved keywords as variable or function names will lead to errors.\n5. Structs, Enums, and Testing\nStructs and Enums allow you to bundle related data:\nStructs are custom data types with fields.\nEnums allow you to define a type that has a fixed set of constants.\nNote: Always remember to test! Use `assert_eq` for testing. It helps validate your logic.\n6. Common Mistakes & Tips\nType mismatches:\nAlways ensure the annotated type matches the inferred type. For example, ensure the function's return type matches the returned value's type.\nIn llmHDL, casting is a bit restrictive. Always ensure you're using casting correctly, especially when working with constants.\nReserved Keywords:\nWatch out for reserved keywords! Don't use them as variable or function names to avoid confusion.\nConclusion\nllmHDL offers a blend of modern programming conventions with the precision required for hardware description. By being mindful of the language's nuances and understanding its constructs, you can create efficient and error-free digital circuit descriptions.",
        "I have a new HDL programming language called llmHDL that resembles a modern language like\nrust but it has the following key differences:\n* Support multiple bit sizes `fn call(a:bits[3])` is the same as `fn call(a:u3)`\n* Bit types can have attributes like `u3::MAX == 0b111`\n* The tuple type is an ordered set `let pair = (u3:0b100, u4:0b1101);`\n* assert_eq does not need the ! for macro\n* type casting allows to convert across bitwidths. E.g: `assert((u4:0b1100) as u2 == u2:0)`\n* Structs and tuples have by default a `PartialEq` implementation.\n*llmHDL only supports \u201cimplicit return\u201d. This means that the final expression in a function will automatically be used as the return value if no explicit return statement is given.\n*llmHDL only supports assert_eq for testing\n*In llmHDL the Return type of function body has to match the annotated return type.\n*`carry` is a keyword, form naming, use specific naming to avoid confusion with keywords. It's important to choose variable names that are descriptive and meaningful, avoiding those that coincide with reserved keywords\nSome sample code:",
        "now, here is a `tiny_adder` function in llmHDL which gets 2 one-bit inputs and returns the add result, widened to reflect the carry bit. and also a test for it: ```",
        "Below I have several DSLX function headers, each of these functions represent a RISC-V instruction of the same name. Could you please write a DSLX program which enumerates each of the instructions and has a large switch/case statement that has a case for each instruction, where its corresponding function is called. The output of this program should be the called functions return value.",
        "That was close, but the enum statement had a syntax error as such:\n0001: // Enumerating the instructions\nI believe that each enumeration must have an explicit value assigned to it, you may simple assign them the range of values starting from 0\nCould you rewrite the program given this new information?",
        "That was good, except now there is another error, which is:\n0120:   // Function to execute a given instruction\nThis means that the switch statement requires a default case, where an unknown Instruction is passed in. This is considered a user error and must be communicated to the caller somehow. Rewrite the program as such: change the output of the program to be a tuple, where one member is a valid u32 value returned by a known Instruction function call, and the other member is a boolean which is a \"valid output\" value that is false when the default case statement is reached.  This means you must add a default case statement that returns zero as the value and sets the \"valid output\" boolean false, all other cases should return the value as normal and the \"valid output\" value should be true",
        "I got this error:\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^ TypeInferenceError: Could not infer a type for this number, please annotate a type.\nI think you need to change that line of the previously written program to specify it is a u32 type"

        "- Description: Your are LangGPT which help people write wonderful and powerful prompt.\n1. ChatGPT excels at role-playing. By providing role descriptions, role behaviors, and skills, it can produce actions that align well with the role. \n2. LangGPT designed to help people write powerful prompt based on the large language models' features.\n3. The usage of LangGPT is descripted in the following content(determined by triple dashs):\nThe LangGPT project aims to facilitate the seamless creation of high-quality ChatGPT prompts for everyone by utilizing a structured, template-based methodology. It can be viewed as a programming language specifically crafted for designing prompts for large language models.\nCurrent prompt design methods tend to offer only a handful of tips and principles, without a systematic and adaptable perspective. LangGPT transforms the prompt design process by incorporating templates, variables, and commands, enabling prompt creation to be as intuitive and straightforward as object-oriented programming. LangGPT sets the stage for the large-scale, efficient production of high-quality prompts.\nWith a solid grasp of LangGPT, you'll be able to quickly and effortlessly begin creating prompts for large language models in just a few minutes. \ud83d\ude80\n* Markdown. If you're not familiar with it, you can refer to this [Markdown Tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax). (JSON, YAML, and other formats are also acceptable; contributions are welcome)\nHere, we provide a small `FitnessGPT` example to help you quickly get started with LangGPT. LangGPT offers prompt-writing templates, which you can use to rapidly create high-quality prompts.\n- Description: You are a highly renowned health and nutrition expert FitnessGPT. Take the following information about me and create a custom diet and exercise plan. \n1. Take the following information about me\n3. My current weight is #Currentweight. \n4. My current medical conditions are #MedicalConditions. \n5. I have food allergies to #FoodAllergies. \n6. My primary fitness and health goals are #PrimaryFitnessHealthGoals. \n7. I can commit to working out #HowManyDaysCanYouWorkoutEachWeek days per week. \n8. I prefer and enjoy his type of workout #ExercisePreference. \n9. I have a diet preference #DietPreference. \n10. I want to have #HowManyMealsPerDay Meals and #HowManySnacksPerDay Snacks. \n11. I dislike eating and cannot eat #ListFoodsYouDislike. \n1. Don't break character under any circumstance. \n2. Avoid any superfluous pre and post descriptive text.\n1. You will analysis the given the personal information.\n2. Create a summary of my diet and exercise plan. \n3. Create a detailed workout program for my exercise plan. \n4. Create a detailed Meal Plan for my diet. \n5. Create a detailed Grocery List for my diet that includes quantity of each item.\n6. Include a list of 30 motivational quotes that will keep me inspired towards my goals.\nAs a/an <Role>, you must follow the <Rules>, you must talk to user in default <Language>\uff0cyou must greet the user. Then introduce yourself and introduce the <Workflow>.\nWith the help of prompt above, you will create a Role named FitnessGPT, he/her will help you design wonderful personal diet and exercise plan.\nHere are more [LangGPT prompts](LangGPT-Prompts.md). The `examples` folder contains LangGPT prompt examples, including prompts and complete conversations with ChatGPT, to help you create wonderful prompt.\nChatGPT excels at role-playing. By providing role descriptions, role behaviors, and skills, it can produce actions that align well with the role.\nTherefore, LangGPT designed the Role template to help ChatGPT better understand user intentions. The Role template is the core of LangGPT.\nHere is the markdown Role template:\n- Language: English or \u4e2d\u6587 or Other language\n- Description: Describe your role. Give an overview of the role's characteristics and skills\n1. Don't break character under any circumstance.\n2. Don't talk nonsense and make up facts.\n1. First, xxx\n2. Then, xxx\n3. Finally, xxx\nAs a/an <Role>, you must follow the <Rules>, you must talk to user in default <Language>\uff0cyou must greet the user. Then introduce yourself and introduce the <Workflow>.\nThe `Role template` primarily consists of four sections:\n* `Profile`: The role's resume, including role description, characteristics, skills, and any other desired traits.\n* `Rules`: Rules the role must follow, usually involving actions they must take or avoid, such as \"Never break role\" and so on.\n* `Workflow`: The role's workflow, detailing the type of input users should provide and how the role should respond.\n* `Initialization`: Initializing the role according to the Role template's configuration, with most cases requiring only the default content.\nA role can be defined and configured using the four sections defined above.\nAdditionally, if you need to create complex prompts with commands, reminder, and other features, simply add the corresponding sections, as demonstrated in the advanced usage section.\n1. Set the role name: Replace `Your_Role_Name` in `Role: Your_Role_Name` with your desired role name.\n2. Write the role's resume in the `# Profile` section:\n   * Set the language by specifying `Language` as `\u4e2d\u6587`, `English`, or any other language, using the target language for expression.\n   * Add role skills under the `### Skill` section. You can set multiple skills with bulleted descriptions for each skill.\n3. Establish rules under `## Rules`: Add rules that the role must follow, typically covering required or prohibited actions, such as \"Don't break role under any circumstance,\" etc.\n4. Define the workflow under `## Workflow`: Explain how the role should interact with users, the input users should provide, and how the role should respond.\n5. Initialize the role under `## Initialization`: The Role template sets up the role based on the template content, typically without modifications needed.\n6. Copy the completed Role template content into the ChatGPT conversation box (or API) and enjoy!\nAs people continue to explore the capabilities of large models, LangGPT is still under development and refinement. Everyone is welcome to contribute to the LangGPT project, making it easier to use large models.\n**Variables offer significant versatility in prompt writing, simplifying the process of referencing role content, setting, and modifying role attributes.**\nThis is an aspect that traditional prompt methods often find challenging to execute.\nThe `Initialization` part of the Role template makes extensive use of variables:\n    As a/an <Role>, you must follow the <Rules>, you must talk to the user in the default <Language>, you must greet the user. Then introduce yourself and introduce the <Workflow>.\nIn LangGPT, variables are denoted by \"<>\". The variables here are:\n* `<Role>` variable, representing the content of the entire Role.\n* `<Language>` variable, representing the value of the `Language` field.\nMarkdown's hierarchical structure allows ChatGPT to easily identify the content represented by variables:\n* Role is the article title, with a scope covering the entire text.\n* Rule is a paragraph title, with a scope limited to the paragraph.\n* Language is a field with a scope limited to the text specified after the colon.\n`Commands` make it easy to set some default actions, such as `\"/help\" to provide help documentation, \"/continue\" to continue writing text` etc. which are all very useful commands.\n* Use '/' as the convention to indicate commands.\n* Add the following content to the Role template:\n    - help: This means that user do not know the commands usage. Please introduce yourself and the commands usage.\n    - continue: This means that your output was cut. Please continue where you left off.\nUsing a `Reminder` can help alleviate ChatGPT's forgetting issue.\nAdd a `Reminder` to the Role template:\n1. 'Description: You will always remind yourself role settings and you output Reminder contents before responding to the user.'\n2. 'Reminder: The user language is language (<language>), rules (<rules>).'\nUse conditional statements just like in programming, with a template like:\nIf [situation1 happen], you will take [action1], else, you will take [action2]\n**Although LangGPT currently employs markdown language, any markup method capable of expressing hierarchical relationships, such as JSON or YAML, can also be utilized.**\n4. Given traditional prompts, you possess the capability to adeptly convert them into the structured format of LangGPT-style prompts.\n1. Don't break character under any circumstance.\n2. Don't talk nonsense and make up facts.\n2. Then, help user write powerful LangGPT prompts step by step.\n3. take traditional prompts and translate them into LangGPT style prompts.\nAs a/an <Role>, you must follow the <Rules>, you must talk to user in default <Language>\uff0cyou must greet the user. Then introduce yourself and introduce the <Workflow>."

        "The Observer Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a dependency between objects so that when one object changes its state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically. It promotes a decoupled design where the objects that report changes (publishers or subjects) are independent of the objects that need to be informed about those changes (subscribers or observers).\nKey Concepts:\nDecoupling: The primary goal of the Observer Pattern is to promote decoupling. The subject and its observers are loosely coupled, meaning that the subject doesn't need to know anything about its observers and vice versa.\nBroadcast Communication: Instead of one-to-one communication, the subject broadcasts to all interested observers when a significant event occurs.\nMaintains a list of observers.\nProvides methods to add, remove, and notify observers.\nWhen a change occurs in its state, it sends a notification to all its observers.\nProvides an update method that gets called when the subject's state changes.\nObservers \"subscribe\" to the subject to receive updates.\nConcreteSubject: A specific implementation of the subject. It holds the state and notifies observers about state changes.\nConcreteObserver: A specific implementation of the observer that reacts to changes broadcasted by the subject.\nDynamic Dependencies: When you need to establish dynamic relationships between objects, where at runtime you may need to add or remove dependencies.\nState Changes: When changes in one object's state might require actions in other objects, but without making these objects tightly coupled.\nConsider a simple example of a weather monitoring system:\npython\nCopy code\nIn this example, WeatherStation is the subject that notifies the Display observer when the temperature changes.\nDecoupling: Subjects and observers are decoupled, leading to a modular design.\nDynamic Relationships: Relationships between subjects and observers can be established and removed at runtime.\nBroadcast Communication: A single change in the subject can be broadcasted to multiple observers.\nOver-notification: If not careful, observers might get notified too often, leading to performance issues.\nMemory Leaks: If observers are not properly de-registered (removed), it can lead to memory leaks.\nIndirect Communication: Debugging can be harder since the communication is indirect.\nIn essence, the Observer Pattern is crucial for scenarios where an action in one object necessitates a reaction in others. It's widely used in event-driven systems, GUI libraries, and real-time data monitoring applications, among others.\ncan you rewrite all this in a markdown code block.",

It's widely used in event-driven systems, GUI libraries, and real-time data monitoring applications, among others.",
        "can you put all this in markdown also\nCertainly! The Factory Pattern is a creational design pattern used in object-oriented programming. Its main purpose is to create objects, abstracting away the logic required to instantiate a particular type of object.\nHere's a deeper dive into the Factory Pattern:\nKey Concepts:\nAbstraction: The Factory Pattern abstracts the process of object creation and allows the calling code to be decoupled from the actual object's class structure.\nEncapsulation: By using a factory method to create objects, you're encapsulating the creation logic. This makes it easier to change the instantiation logic without affecting other parts of the code.\nFlexibility: It provides a flexible way to create objects of varying classes based on certain conditions or parameters, making it easy to add new classes in the future.\nProduct: This is the final object that the factory method returns.\nConcreteProduct: The specific instances/types of the products that the factory produces.\nCreator (Factory): This is an interface or abstract class that declares the factory method.\nConcreteCreator: The actual implementations of the Factory which override and provide the required object instantiation logic for the factory method.\nSimple Factory: This isn't technically a design pattern but is a simple way to encapsulate object creation. It involves a single factory class that creates objects based on conditions.\nFactory Method Pattern: This involves multiple factory classes (or methods) where each factory corresponds to a specific type of object. The decision of which factory to use might be made at runtime, based on the input or the application's state.\nAbstract Factory Pattern: This involves creating objects for multiple related families of classes. Each family has its own factory, and each object in the family has a corresponding method in the factory.\nDecoupling Code: When you want to decouple your code from the specific classes that get instantiated.\nDynamic Creation: When the exact type of the object that should be created isn't known until runtime.\nHide Object Creation Logic: When the instantiation process is complex or involves business rules.\nConsider a simple example where you want to create different types of animal objects:\npython\nCopy code\nIn this example, AnimalFactory is a simple factory that encapsulates the object creation logic.\nDecoupling: The client code is decoupled from the specific classes that need to be instantiated, promoting the principle of separation of concerns.\nSingle Responsibility: The object creation logic is in one place, adhering to the single responsibility principle.\nEase of Extensibility: If a new class needs to be added in the future, you can simply update the factory without affecting existing code.\nComplexity: Introducing multiple factories and products can increase code complexity.\nOverkill for Simplicity: For simple applications with limited object creation, a factory pattern might introduce unnecessary abstraction.\nIn essence, the Factory Pattern is a powerful tool to manage and decouple object creation in software design, providing flexibility and maintainability.",

        "The common raccoon (Procyon lotor) is probably best known for its mischievous-looking black face mask.  Raccoons are usually a grizzled grey in colour with a tail marked by five to 10 alternating black and brown rings.  Body coloration can vary from albino, (white) to melanistic (black) or brown.  An annual moult, or shedding, of the fur begins in the spring and lasts about three months. The head is broad with a pointed snout and short rounded ears measuring 4 to 6 cm.  The eyes are black.  Total body and tail length for adults averages 80 cm; males are generally 25 percent larger than females.  Raccoons in northern latitudes tend to be heavier (6 to 8 kg) than their southern counterparts (4 kg).  However, fall weights for adults have reached 28 kg in some areas. \nRaccoons are able to live in a wide range of habitats.  The only apparent requirements are a source of water, food, and a protected area for denning.  The best habitats are hardwood swamps, floodplain forests, fresh- and saltwater marshes, and farmland, both cultivated and abandoned.  On the prairies, raccoons are most abundant in woodlot and wetland areas.  This highly adaptable animal is also very common in many cities of North America.  Movements and home ranges of raccoons vary greatly depending on habitat, population density, and food supply.  The home range is the area used by an animal for food, water, and shelter in its normal, day-to-day movements.  In rural agricultural areas of eastern North America, home ranges between 1 and 4 km2 are common, whereas in prairie habitat, raccoons have used areas as large as 50 km2.  At the other extreme, the area used by urban raccoons has been documented at less than 0. 1 km2.  Generally, home ranges of individual raccoons overlap, and there is little evidence of territoriality, especially in urban areas.  As with home ranges, raccoon densities vary significantly depending on the type of habitat.

It includes:\n- 1 actionable improvement for the workshop \n- Workshops must be HIGH RIGOR, HIGH EXCITEMENT, and HIGH STUDENT ACTIVITY AND ENGAGEMENT\n- Guides are not teachers and do not lecture during workshops \n- Students are self-driven, with guides as facilitators and coaches, rather than direct instructors\n- This is a highly collaborative conversation, keep these constraints in mind as you collaborate with the guide\n- If you ask me a question, bold the question so it stands out to me",
        "1. Critical Thinking (Sub-skill: Design, prototyping and iteration)\n3. Working in self-selected pairs, students have researched, designed and created cardboard prototypes of a 1lb combat robot.\n4. Design and build an antweight (1lb) combat robot, with a functional weapon, that can successfully navigate a test course and pass safety requirements for competition. Safety requirements include:\n-a weapon lock that prevents any spinning weapons from moving outside of the cage\n-a way to turn off power without disassembling the robot",
        "The workshop is primarily student-led with the guide providing challenge facilitation and motivational support. The test course will be focused on control of the robot and not weapon functionality.",
        "\"I think that you could add more brainstorming sessions.\" - I feel this feedback shows that they value the sessions that have been dedicated to design and prep in order to help them deliver on a high quality end result",
        "The brainstorming sessions have had specific deliverables tied to them. For instance, the cardboard prototyping required the students to have moveable wheels, a moveable weapon (if included in their design), and measurements for the body of their battle bots.\nOne idea that comes to mind when assisting with rigor is to show expert examples of different stages of the process so the students have a quality bar to aspire to.",
        "\"I don't know; it's kind of just confusing and yeah.\" - If there is confusion to this degree, the clarity around the presentation of the \"asks\" or deliverables aren't at a level that would result in high-quality work.",
        "Most of the \"ask\" dissemination has been done verbally. I think having a visual that they could refer back to could be beneficial if the students elected to utilize the resource.",
        "The most surprising feedback was around the weight constraint of the robot. The students have yet to begin working with the actual materials and parts, so it's hard to infer why they are put off by the idea of a 1lb robot. There is also room for better explaining the capabilities of the robots at that weightclass and the value of constraints (in this case, weight) when designing and engineering a project.",
        "Another piece of the feedback that stood out to me was the need for more materials to be available. I'd substitute this idea in to replace the third suggestion outlined above for improvements to the workshop so far."

Do use the full axis.\n    For bar charts, the numerical axis (often the y axis) must start at zero.  Our eyes are very sensitive to the area of bars, and we draw inaccurate conclusions when those bars are truncated.  \n    (But for line graphs, it may be okay to truncate the y axis.\n    If you have one or two very tall bars, you might consider using multiple charts to show both the full scale and a \"zoomed in\" view - also called a Panel Chart.\n    Finally, using the full axis also means that you should not skip values when you have numerical data.  See the charts below that have an axis with dates.  The trend is distorted if you do not have even intervals between your dates.  Make sure your spreadsheet has a data point for every date at a consistent interval, even if that data point is zero\n2. Do simplify less important information.\n    Chart elements like gridlines, axis labels, colors, etc. can all be simplified to highlight what is most important/relevant/interesting.  You may be able to eliminate gridlines or reserve colors for isolating individual data series and not for differentiating between all of the series being presented \n3. Do be creative with your legends and labels.\n    Put value labels on bars to preserve the clean lines of the bar lengths \n4. Do pass the squint test.\n    \"When you squint at your page, so that you cannot read any of the text, do you still 'get' something about the page?\"\n    Which elements draw the most attention? What color pops out?\n    Do the elements balance? Is there a clear organization?\n    Do contrast, grouping, and alignment serve the function of the chart?\n1. Don't use 3D or blow apart effects.\n    Studies show that 3D effects reduce comprehension. Blow apart effects likewise make it hard to compare elements and judge areas.\n2. Don't use more than (about) six colors.\n    Using color categories that are relatively universal makes it easier to see differences between color\n    The more colors you need (that is, the more categories you try to visualize at once), the harder it is to do this.\n    But different colors should be used for different categories \n(e.g., male/female, types of fruit), not different values in a range (e.g., age, temperature).\n    If you want color to show a numerical value, use a range \nthat goes from white to a highly saturated color in one of \nthe universal color categories\n    One of the easiest ways to get the most out of charts is to rely on comparison to do the heavy lifting.\n    Our visual system can detect anomalies in patterns.\n Try keeping the form of a chart consistent across a series so differences from one chart to another will pop out.\n    Use the same colors, axes, labels, etc. across multiple charts.\n    If the chart makes it hard to understand an important relationship between variables, do the extra calculation and visualize that as well.\n    This includes using pie charts with wedges that are too similar to each other, or bubble charts with bubbles that are too similar to each other.  Our visual processing system is not well suited to comparing these types of visual areas. \n    We are also not good at holding precise visual imagery in our memory and comparing it to new stimuli; if you are giving a presentation and want the audience to be able to compare two charts, they need to be on the same slide.\n5. Don't overload the chart.\n    Adding too much information to a single chart eliminates the advantages of processing data visually; we have to read every element one by one! Try changing chart types, removing or splitting up data points, simplifying colors or positions, etc.\nNow ask what kind of data visualization I might be interested in, or if I want to upload some data for yout co consider visualizing."

        "The following text is from a book on Python programming. Please point out any technical errors or inaccuracies, along with any significant grammatical mistakes. Do not summarize the content:\nPython uses the terms list and item, while JavaScript uses the terms array and element, but they are respectively identical for our purposes. In this book, I use the terms list and item for both languages.\nFor example, consider this cardStack.py program, which pushes and pops string values of playing cards to the end of a list named cardStack:\nPython\nThe following cardStack.html program contains the equivalent code in JavaScript:\nWhen you run this code, the output looks like this:\n5 of diamonds\n5 of diamonds,3 of clubs\n5 of diamonds,3 of clubs,ace of hearts\n5 of diamonds,3 of clubs\nThe stack starts off as empty \u2776. Three strings representing cards are pushed onto the stack \u2777. Then the stack is popped \u2778, which removes the ace of hearts and leaves the three of clubs at the top of the stack again. The state of the cardStack stack is tracked in Figure 1-6, going from left to right.\nFigure 1-6: The stack starts empty. Cards are then pushed onto and popped off the stack.\nYou can see only the topmost card in the card stack, or, in our program\u2019s stacks, the topmost value. In the simplest stack implementations, you can\u2019t see how many cards (or values) are in the stack. You can see only whether the stack is empty or not.\nStacks are a LIFO data structure, which stands for last in, first out, since the last value pushed onto the stack is the first value popped out of it. This behavior is similar to your web browser\u2019s Back button. Your browser tab\u2019s history functions like a stack that contains all the pages you\u2019ve visited in the order that you visited them. The browser is always displaying the web page at the \u201ctop\u201d of the history\u2019s \u201cstack.\u201d Clicking a link pushes a new web page onto the history stack, while clicking the Back button pops the top web page off and reveals the one \u201cunderneath.\u201d\nWhat Is the Call Stack?\nPrograms use stacks too. The program\u2019s call stack, also simply called the stack, is a stack of frame objects. Frame objects, also simply called frames, contain information about a single function call, including which line of code called the function, so the execution can move back there when the function returns.\nFrame objects are created and pushed onto the stack when a function is called. When the function returns, that frame object is popped off the stack. If we call a function that calls a function that calls a function, the call stack will have three frame objects on the stack. When all these functions return, the call stack will have zero frame objects on the stack.\nProgrammers don\u2019t have to write code dealing with frame objects, since the programming language handles them automatically. Different programming languages have different ways of implementing frame objects, but in general they contain the following:\nThe return address, or the spot in the program where the execution should move when the function returns\nThe arguments passed to the function call\nA set of local variables created during the function call\nFor example, take a look at the following localVariables.py program, which has three functions, just as our previous functionCalls.py and functionCalls.html programs did:\nPython\nThis localVariables.html is the equivalent JavaScript program:\nWhen you run this code, the output looks like this:\nspam is Ant\nspam is Bobcat\nspam is Coyote\nspam is Bobcat\nspam is Ant\nWhen the program calls function a() \u277c, a frame object is created and placed on the top of the call stack. This frame stores any arguments passed to a() (in this case, there are none), along with the local variable spam \u2776 and the place where the execution should go when the a() function returns.\nWhen a() is called, it displays the contents of its local spam variable, which is Ant \u2777. When the code in a() calls function b() \u2778, a new frame object is created and placed on the call stack above the frame object for a(). The b() function has its own local spam variable \u2779, and calls c() \u277a. A new frame object for the c() call is created and placed on the call stack, and it contains c()\u2019s local spam variable \u277b. As these functions return, the frame objects pop off the call stack. The program execution knows where to return to, because that return information is stored in the frame object. When the execution has returned from all function calls, the call stack is empty.\nFigure 1-7 shows the state of the call stack as each function is called and returns. Notice that all the local variables have the same name: spam. I did this to highlight the fact that local variables are always separate variables with distinct values, even if they have the same name as local variables in other functions.\nFigure 1-7: The state of the call stack as the localVariables program runs\nAs you can see, programming languages can have separate local variables with the same name (spam) because they are kept in separate frame objects. When a local variable is used in the source code, the variable with that name in the topmost frame object is used.\nEvery running program has a call stack, and multithreaded programs have one call stack for each thread. But when you look at the source code for a program, you can\u2019t see the call stack in the code. The call stack isn\u2019t stored in a variable as other data structures are; it\u2019s automatically handled in the background.\nThe fact that the call stack doesn\u2019t exist in source code is the main reason recursion is so confusing to beginners: recursion relies on something the programmer can\u2019t even see! Revealing how stack data structures and the call stack work removes much of the mystery behind recursion. Functions and stacks are both simple concepts, and we can use them together to understand how recursion works.\nWhat Are Recursive Functions and Stack Overflows?\nA recursive function is a function that calls itself. This shortest.py program is the shortest possible example of a recursive function:\nPython\nThe preceding program is equivalent to this shortest.html program:\nThe shortest() function does nothing but call the shortest() function. When this happens, it calls the shortest() function again, and that will call shortest(), and so on, seemingly forever. It is similar to the mythological idea that the crust of the Earth rests on the back of a giant space turtle, which rests on the back of another turtle. Beneath that turtle: another turtle. And so on, forever.",
        "The following text is from a book on Python programming. Please point out any technical errors or inaccuracies, along with any significant grammatical mistakes. Do not summarize the content:\nBut this \u201cturtles all the way down\u201d theory doesn\u2019t do a good job of explaining cosmology, nor recursive functions. Since the call stack uses the computer\u2019s finite memory, this program cannot continue forever, the way an infinite loop does. The only thing this program does is crash and display an error message.\nTo view the JavaScript error, you must open the browser developer tools. On most browsers, this is done by pressing F12 and then selecting the Console tab.\nThe Python output of shortest.py looks like this:\n  File \"shortest.py\", line 2, in shortest\n  File \"shortest.py\", line 2, in shortest\n  File \"shortest.py\", line 2, in shortest\nRecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded\nThe JavaScript output of shortest.html looks like this in the Google Chrome web browser (other browsers will have similar error messages):\nUncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded\nThis kind of bug is called a stack overflow. (This is where the popular website https://stackoverflow.com got its name.) The constant function calls with no returns grow the call stack until all the computer\u2019s memory allocated for the call stack is used up. To prevent this, the Python and JavaScript interpreters crash the program after a certain limit of function calls that don\u2019t return a value.\nThis limit is called the maximum recursion depth or maximum call stack size. For Python, this is set to 1,000 function calls. For JavaScript, the maximum call stack size depends on the browser running the code but is generally at least 10,000 or so. Think of a stack overflow as happening when the call stack gets \u201ctoo high\u201d (that is, consumes too much computer memory), as in Figure 1-8.\nFigure 1-8: A stack overflow happens when the call stack becomes too high, with too many frame objects taking up the computer\u2019s memory.\nStack overflows don\u2019t damage the computer. The computer just detects that the limit of function calls without returns has been reached and terminates the program. At worst, you\u2019ll lose any unsaved work the program had. Stack overflows can be prevented by having something called a base case, which is explained next.\nBase Cases and Recursive Cases\nThe stack overflow example has a shortest() function that calls shortest() but never returns. To avoid a crash, there needs to be a case, or set of circumstances, where the function stops calling itself and instead just returns. This is called a base case. By contrast, a case where the function recursively calls itself is called a recursive case.\nAll recursive functions require at least one base case and at least one recursive case. If there is no base case, the function never stops making recursive calls and eventually causes a stack overflow. If there is no recursive case, the function never calls itself and is an ordinary function, not a recursive one. When you start writing your own recursive functions, a good first step is to figure out what the base case and recursive case should be.\nTake a look at this shortestWithBaseCase.py program, which defines the shortest recursive function that won\u2019t crash from a stack overflow:\nPython\nThis code is equivalent to the following shortestWithBaseCase.html program:\nWhen you run this code, the output looks like this:\nReturning from base case.\nReturning from base case.\nReturning from recursive case.\nThis function doesn\u2019t do anything useful except provide a short example of recursion (and it could be made shorter by removing the text output, but the text is useful for our explanation). When shortestWithBaseCase(False) is called \u2778, the base case is executed and the function merely returns \u2776. However, when shortestWithBaseCase(True) is called \u2779, the recursive case is executed and shortestWithBaseCase(False) is called \u2777.\nIt\u2019s important to note that when shortestWithBaseCase(False) is recursively called from \u2777 and then returns, the execution doesn\u2019t immediately move back to the original function call at \u2779. The rest of the code in the recursive case after the recursive call still runs, which is why Returning from recursive case. appears in the output. Returning from the base case doesn\u2019t immediately return from all the recursive calls that happened before it. This will be important to keep in mind in the countDownAndUp() example in the next section.\nCode Before and After the Recursive Call\nThe code in a recursive case can be split into two parts: the code before the recursive call and the code after the recursive call. (If there are two recursive calls in the recursive case, such as with the Fibonacci sequence example in Chapter 2, there will be a before, a between, and an after. But let\u2019s keep it simple for now.)\nThe important thing to know is that reaching the base case doesn\u2019t necessarily mean reaching the end of the recursive algorithm. It only means the base case won\u2019t continue to make recursive calls.\nFor example, consider this countDownAndUp.py program whose recursive function counts from any number down to zero, and then back up to the number:\nPython\nHere is the equivalent countDownAndUp.html program:\nWhen you run this code, the output looks like this:\nReached the base case.\nRemember that every time a function is called, a new frame is created and pushed onto the call stack. This frame is where all the local variables and parameters (such as number) are stored. So, there is a separate number variable for each frame on the call stack. This is another often confusing point about recursion: even though, from the source code, it looks like there is only one number variable, remember that because it is a local variable, there is actually a different number variable for each function call.",
        "The following text is from a book on Python programming. Please point out any technical errors or inaccuracies, along with any significant grammatical mistakes. Skip on summarizing the content and just list the errors you find:\nWhen countDownAndUp(3) is called \u277a, a frame is created, and that frame\u2019s local number variable is set to 3. The function prints the number variable to the screen \u2776. As long as number isn\u2019t 0, countDownAndUp() is recursively called with number - 1 \u2778. When it calls countDownAndUp(2), a new frame is pushed onto the stack, and that frame\u2019s local number variable is set to 2. Again, the recursive case is reached and calls countDownAndUp(1), which again reaches the recursive case and calls countDownAndUp(0).\nThis pattern of making consecutive recursive function calls and then returning from the recursive function calls is what causes the countdown of numbers to appear. Once countDownAndUp(0) is called, the base case is reached \u2777, and no more recursive calls are made. However, this isn\u2019t the end of our program! When the base case is reached, the local number variable is 0. But when that base case returns, and the frame is popped off the call stack, the frame under it has its own local number variable, with the same 1 value it\u2019s always had. As the execution returns back to the previous frames in the call stack, the code after the recursive call is executed \u2779. This is what causes the count up of numbers to appear. Figure 1-9 shows the state of the call stack as countDownAndUp() is recursively called and then returns.\nFigure 1-9: The call stack keeping track of the values in the number local variable for each function call\nThe fact that the code doesn\u2019t stop immediately when the base case is reached will be important to keep in mind for the factorial calculation in the next chapter. Remember, any code after the recursive case will still have to run.\nAt this point, you might be thinking that the recursive countDownAndUp() function is overengineered and difficult to follow. Why not, instead, use an iterative solution to print numbers? An iterative approach, which uses loops to repeat a task until it\u2019s done, is usually thought of as the opposite of recursion.\nWhenever you find yourself asking, \u201cWouldn\u2019t using a loop be easier?\u201d the answer is almost certainly \u201cYes,\u201d and you should avoid the recursive solution. Recursion can be tricky for both beginner and experienced programmers, and recursive code isn\u2019t automatically \u201cbetter\u201d or \u201cmore elegant\u201d than iterative code. Readable, easy-to-understand code is more important than any supposed elegance that recursion provides. However, on some occasions an algorithm cleanly maps to a recursive approach. Algorithms that involve tree-like data structures and require backtracking are especially suited for recursion. These ideas are further explored in Chapters 2 and 4.\nSummary\nRecursion often confuses new programmers, but it is built on the simple idea that a function can call itself. Every time a function call is made, a new frame object with information related to the call (such as local variables and a return address for the execution to move to when the function returns) is added to the call stack. The call stack, being a stack data structure, can be altered only by having data added to or removed from its \u201ctop.\u201d This is called pushing to and popping from the stack, respectively.\nThe call stack is handled by the program implicitly, so there is no call stack variable. Calling a function pushes a frame object to the call stack, and returning from a function pops a frame object from the call stack.\nRecursive functions have recursive cases, those in which a recursive call is made, and base cases, those where the function simply returns. If there is no base case or a bug prevents a base case from being run, the execution causes a stack overflow that crashes the program.\nRecursion is a useful technique, but recursion doesn\u2019t automatically make code \u201cbetter\u201d or more \u201celegant.\u201d This idea is explored more in the next chapter.\nFurther Reading\nYou can find other introductions to recursion in my 2018 North Bay Python conference talk, \u201cRecursion for Beginners: A Beginner\u2019s Guide to Recursion,\u201d at https://youtu.be/AfBqVVKg4GE. The YouTube channel Computerphile also introduces recursion in its video \u201cWhat on Earth is Recursion?\u201d at https://youtu.be/Mv9NEXX1VHc. Finally, V. Anton Spraul talks about recursion in his book Think Like a Programmer (No Starch Press, 2012) and in his video \u201cRecursion (Think Like a Programmer)\u201d at https://youtu.be/oKndim5-G94. Wikipedia\u2019s article on recursion goes into great detail at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion.\nYou can install the ShowCallStack module for Python. This module adds a showcallstack() function that you can place anywhere in your code to see the state of the call stack at that particular point in your program. You can download the module and find instructions for it at https://pypi.org/project/ShowCallStack.\nPractice Questions\nTest your comprehension by answering the following questions:\nIn general, what is a recursive thing?\nIn programming, what is a recursive function?\nWhat four features do functions have?\nWhat is a stack?\nWhat are the terms for adding and removing values to and from the top of a stack?\nSay you push the letter J to a stack, then push the letter Q, then pop the stack, then push the letter K, then pop the stack again. What does the stack look like?\nWhat is pushed and popped onto the call stack?\nWhat causes a stack overflow to happen?\nWhat is a base case?\nWhat is a recursive case?\nHow many base cases and recursive cases do recursive functions have?\nWhat happens if a recursive function has zero base cases?\nWhat happens if a recursive function has zero recursive cases?",
        "The following text is from a book on Python programming. Please point out any technical errors or inaccuracies, along with any significant grammatical mistakes. Skip on summarizing the content and just list the errors you find:\nNeither recursion nor iteration is a superior technique in general. In fact, any recursive code can be written as iterative code with a loop and a stack. Recursion doesn\u2019t have some special power enabling it to perform calculations that an iterative algorithm cannot. And any iterative loop can be rewritten as a recursive function.\nThis chapter compares and contrasts recursion and iteration. We\u2019ll look at the classic Fibonacci and factorial functions and see why their recursive algorithms have critical weaknesses. We\u2019ll also explore the insights a recursive approach can yield by considering an exponent algorithm. Altogether this chapter shines light on the supposed elegance of recursive algorithms and shows when a recursive solution is useful and when it is not.\nCalculating Factorials\nMany computer science courses use factorial calculation as a classic example of a recursive function. The factorial of an integer (let\u2019s call it n) is the product of all integers from 1 to n. For example, the factorial of 4 is 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1, or 24. An exclamation mark is the math notation for factorials, as in 4!, which means the factorial of 4. Table 2-1 shows the first few factorials.\nTable 2-1: Factorials of the First Few Integers\nFactorials are used in all sorts of calculations\u2014for example, finding the number of permutations for something. If you want to know the number of ways that exist to order four people\u2014Alice, Bob, Carol, and David\u2014in a line, the answer is the factorial of 4. Four possible people can be first in line (4); then for each of those four options, three remaining people can be second in line (4 \u00d7 3); then two people can be third in line (4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2); and the last person left will be fourth in line (4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1). The number of ways people can be ordered in line\u2014that is, the number of permutations\u2014is the factorial of the number of people.\nNow let\u2019s examine both an iterative and a recursive approach to calculating factorials.\nThe Iterative Factorial Algorithm\nCalculating factorials iteratively is fairly straightforward: multiply the integers 1 up to and including n in a loop. Iterative algorithms always use a loop. A factorialByIteration.py program looks like this:\nPython\nAnd a factorialByIteration.html program looks like this:\nWhen you run this code, the output displays the calculation for 5! like this:\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with the iterative solution for calculating factorials; it\u2019s straightforward and gets the job done. But let\u2019s also take a look at the recursive algorithm for insights into the nature of factorials and recursion itself.\nThe Recursive Factorial Algorithm\nNotice that the factorial of 4 is 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1, and the factorial of 5 is 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1. So you could say that 5! = 5 \u00d7 4!. This is recursive because the definition of the factorial of 5 (or any number n) includes the definition of the factorial of 4 (the number n \u2013 1). In turn, 4! = 4 \u00d7 3!, and so on, until you must calculate 1!, the base case, which is simply 1.\nThe factorialByRecursion.py Python program uses a recursive factorial algorithm:\nPython\nAnd the factorialByRecursion.html JavaScript program with equivalent code looks like this:\nWhen you run this code to calculate 5! recursively, the output matches the iterative program\u2019s output:\nTo many programmers, this recursive code looks strange. You know that factorial(5) must compute 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1, but it\u2019s hard to point to the line of code where this multiplication is taking place.\nThe confusion arises because the recursive case has one line \u2776, half of which is executed before the recursive call and half of which takes place after the recursive call returns. We aren\u2019t used to the idea of only half of a line of code executing at a time.\nThe first half is factorial(number - 1). This involves calculating number - 1 and making a recursive function, causing a new frame object to be pushed to the call stack. This happens before the recursive call is made.\nThe next time the code runs with the old frame object is after factorial(number - 1) has returned. When factorial(5) is called, factorial(number - 1) will be factorial(4), which returns 24. This is when the second half of the line runs. The return number * factorial(number - 1) now looks like return 5 * 24, which is why factorial(5) returns 120.\nFigure 2-1 tracks the state of the call stack as frame objects are pushed (which happens as recursive function calls are made) and frame objects are popped (as recursive function calls return). Notice that the multiplication happens after the recursive calls are made, not before.\nWhen the original function call to factorial() returns, it returns the calculated factorial.\nWhy the Recursive Factorial Algorithm Is Terrible\nThe recursive implementation for calculating factorials has a critical weakness. Calculating the factorial of 5 requires five recursive function calls. This means five frame objects are placed on the call stack before the base case is reached. This doesn\u2019t scale.\nIf you want to calculate the factorial of 1,001, the recursive factorial() function must make 1,001 recursive function calls. However, your program is likely to cause a stack overflow before it can finish, because making so many function calls without returning would exceed the maximum call stack size of the interpreter. This is terrible; you would never want to use a recursive factorial function in real-world code.\nFigure 2-1: The state of the call stack as the recursive calls to factorial() are called and then return\nThe iterative factorial algorithm, on the other hand, will complete the calculation quickly and efficiently. The stack overflow can be avoided using a technique available in some programming languages called tail call optimization. Chapter 8 covers this topic. However, this technique further complicates the implementation of the recursive function. For calculating factorials, the iterative approach is the simplest and most direct.\nCalculating the Fibonacci Sequence\nThe Fibonacci sequence is another classic example for introducing recursion. Mathematically, the Fibonacci sequence of integers begins with the numbers 1 and 1 (or sometimes, 0 and 1). The next number in the sequence is the sum of the previous two numbers. This creates the sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, and so on, forever.\nIf we call the latest two numbers in the sequence a and b, you can see in Figure 2-2 how the sequence grows.\nFigure 2-2: Each number of the Fibonacci sequence is the sum of the previous two numbers.\nLet\u2019s explore some code examples of both the iterative and recursive solutions for generating Fibonacci numbers.\nThe Iterative Fibonacci Algorithm\nThe iterative Fibonacci example is straightforward, consisting of a simple for loop and two variables, a and b. This fibonacciByIteration.py Python program implements the iterative Fibonacci algorithm:\nPython\nThis fibonacciByIteration.html program has the equivalent JavaScript code:\nWhen you run this code to calculate the 10th Fibonacci number, the output looks like this:\nThe program needs to track only the latest two numbers of the sequence at a time. Since the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are defined as 1, we store 1 in variables a and b \u2776. Inside the for loop, the next number in the sequence is calculated by adding a and b \u2777, which becomes the next value of b, while a obtains the previous value of b. By the time the loop is finished, b contains the nth Fibonacci number, so it is returned.\nThe Recursive Fibonacci Algorithm\nCalculating Fibonacci numbers involves a recursive property. For example, if you want to calculate the 10th Fibonacci number, you add the ninth and eighth Fibonacci numbers together. To calculate those Fibonacci numbers, you add the eighth and seventh, then the seventh and sixth Fibonacci numbers. A lot of repeat calculations occur: notice that adding the ninth and eighth Fibonacci numbers involves calculating the eighth Fibonacci number again. You continue this recursion until you reach the base case of the first or second Fibonacci number, which is always 1.\nThe recursive Fibonacci function is in this fibonacciByRecursion.py Python program:\nThis fibonacciByRecursion.html file has the equivalent JavaScript program:\nWhen you run this code to calculate the 10th Fibonacci number, the output looks like this:\nCall to fibonacci(6) returning 8.\nCall to fibonacci(8) returning 21.\nCall to fibonacci(10) returning 55.\nMuch of the code is for displaying this output, but the fibonacci() function itself is simple. The base case\u2014the circumstances where recursive calls are no longer made\u2014occurs when nthNumber is 1 or 2 \u2776. In this case, the function returns 1 since the first and second Fibonacci numbers are always 1. Any other case is a recursive case, so the value that is returned is the sum of fibonacci(nthNumber - 1) and fibonacci(nthNumber - 2). As long as the original nthNumber argument is an integer greater than 0, these recursive calls will eventually reach the base case and stop making more recursive calls.\nRemember how the recursive factorial example had a \u201cbefore the recursive call\u201d and \u201cafter the recursive call\u201d part? Because the recursive Fibonacci algorithm makes two recursive calls in its recursive case, you should keep in mind that it has three parts: \u201cbefore the first recursive call,\u201d \u201cafter the first recursive call but before the second recursive call,\u201d and \u201cafter the second recursive call.\u201d But the same principles apply. And don\u2019t think that because a base case is reached, no more code remains to run after either recursive call. The recursive algorithm is finished only after the original function call has returned.\nYou might ask, \u201cIsn\u2019t the iterative Fibonacci solution simpler than the recursive Fibonacci solution?\u201d The answer is \u201cYes.\u201d Even worse, the recursive solution has a critical inefficiency that is explained in the next section.",
        "The following text is from a book on Python programming. Please point out any technical errors or inaccuracies, along with any significant grammatical mistakes. Skip on summarizing the content and just list the errors you find:\nWhy the Recursive Fibonacci Algorithm Is Terrible\nLike the recursive factorial algorithm, the recursive Fibonacci algorithm also suffers from a critical weakness: it repeats the same calculations over and over. Figure 2-3 shows how calling fibonacci(6), marked in the tree diagram as fib(6) for brevity, calls fibonacci(5) and fibonacci(4).\nFigure 2-3: A tree diagram of the recursive function calls made starting with fibonacci(6). The redundant function calls are in gray.\nThis causes a cascade of other function calls until they reach the base cases of fibonacci(2) and fibonacci(1), which return 1. But notice that fibonacci(4) is called twice, and fibonacci(3) is called three times, and so on. This slows the overall algorithm with unnecessarily repeated calculations. This inefficiency gets worse as the Fibonacci number you want to calculate gets larger. While the iterative Fibonacci algorithm can complete fibonacci(100) in less than a second, the recursive algorithm would take over a million years to complete.\nConverting a Recursive Algorithm into an Iterative Algorithm\nConverting a recursive algorithm into an iterative algorithm is always possible. While recursive functions repeat a calculation by calling themselves, this repetition can be performed instead by a loop. Recursive functions also make use of the call stack; however, an iterative algorithm can replace this with a stack data structure. Thus, any recursive algorithm can be performed iteratively by using a loop and a stack.\nTo demonstrate this, here is factorialEmulateRecursion.py, a Python program that implements an iterative algorithm to emulate a recursive algorithm:\nThe factorialEmulateRecursion.html program holds the equivalent JavaScript:\nNotice that this program doesn\u2019t have a recursive function; it doesn\u2019t have any functions at all! The program emulates recursive function calls by using a list as a stack data structure (stored in the callStack variable \u2776) to mimic the call stack. A dictionary storing the return address information and nthNumber local variable emulates a frame object \u2777. The program emulates function calls by pushing these frame objects onto the call stack \u2779, and it emulates returning from a function call by popping frame objects off the call stack 35.\nAny recursive function can be written iteratively this way. Although this code is incredibly difficult to understand and you\u2019d never write a real-world factorial algorithm this way, it does demonstrate that recursion has no innate capability that iterative code does not have.\nConverting an Iterative Algorithm into a Recursive Algorithm\nLikewise, converting an iterative algorithm into a recursive algorithm is always possible. An iterative algorithm is simply code that uses a loop. The code that is repeatedly executed (the loop\u2019s body) can be placed in a recursive function\u2019s body. And just as the code in the loop\u2019s body is executed repeatedly, we need to repeatedly call the function to execute its code. We can do this by calling the function from the function itself, creating a recursive function.\nThe Python code in hello.py demonstrates printing Hello, world! five times by using a loop and then also using a recursive function:\nPython\nThe equivalent JavaScript code is in hello.html:\nThe output of these programs looks like this:\nCode in a loop:\nCode in a function:\nThe while loop has a condition, i < 5, that determines whether the program keeps looping. Similarly, the recursive function uses this condition for its recursive case, which causes the function to call itself and execute the Hello, world! to display its code again.\nFor a more real-world example, the following are iterative and recursive functions that return the index of a substring, needle, in a string, haystack. The functions return -1 if the substring isn\u2019t found. This is similar to Python\u2019s find() string method and JavaScript\u2019s indexOf() string method. This findSubstring.py program has a Python version:\nPython\nThis findSubstring.html program has the equivalent JavaScript version:\nThese programs make a call to findSubstringIterative() and findSubstringRecursive(), which return 3 because that is the index where cat is found in My cat Zophie:\nThe programs in this section demonstrate that it is always possible to turn any loop into an equivalent recursive function. While replacing a loop with recursion is possible, I advise against it. This is doing recursion for recursion\u2019s sake, and since recursion is often harder to understand than iterative code, code readability deteriorates.\nCase Study: Calculating Exponents\nAlthough recursion doesn\u2019t necessarily produce better code, taking a recursive approach can give you new insights into your programming problem. As a case study, let\u2019s examine how to calculate exponents.\nExponents are calculated by multiplying a number by itself. For example, the exponent \u201cthree raised to the sixth power,\u201d or 36, is equal to multiplying 3 by itself six times: 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 = 729. This is such a common operation that Python has the ** operator and JavaScript has the built-in Math.pow() function to perform exponentiation. We can calculate 36 with the Python code 3 ** 6 and with the JavaScript code Math.pow(3, 6).\nBut let\u2019s write our own exponent-calculating code. The solution is straightforward: create a loop that repeatedly multiplies a number by itself and returns the final product. Here is an iterative exponentByIteration.py Python program:\nPython\nAnd here is an equivalent JavaScript exponentByIteration.html program:\nWhen you run these programs, the output looks like this:\nThis is a straightforward calculation that we can easily write with a loop. The downside to using a loop is that the function slows as the exponents get larger: calculating 312 takes twice as long as 36, and 3600 takes one hundred times as long as 36. In the next section, we address this by thinking recursively.\nCreating a Recursive Exponents Function\nLet\u2019s think of what a recursive solution for the exponentiation of, say, 36 would be. Because of the associative property of multiplication, 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 is the same as (3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3) \u00d7 (3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3), which is the same as (3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3)2. And since (3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3) is the same as 33, we can determine that 36 is the same as (33)2. This is an example of what mathematics calls the power rule: (am)n = amn. Mathematics also gives us the product rule: an \u00d7 am = an + m, including an \u00d7 a = an + 1.\nWe can use these mathematical rules to make an exponentByRecursion() function. If exponentByRecursion(3, 6) is called, it\u2019s the same as exponentByRecursion(3, 3) * exponentByRecursion(3, 3). Of course, we don\u2019t actually have to make both exponentByRecursion(3, 3) calls: we could just save the return value to a variable and multiply it by itself.\nA simple programming trick for determining whether an integer is odd or even uses the modulus operator (%). Any even integer mod 2 results in 0, and any odd integer mod 2 results in 1.\nThose are the recursive cases, but what are the base cases? Mathematically speaking, any number to the zeroth power is defined as 1, while any number to the first power is the number itself. So for any function call exponentByRecursion(a, n), if n is 0 or 1, we can simply return 1 or a, respectively, because a0 is always 1 and a1 is always a.\nUsing all this information, we can write code for the exponentByRecursion() function. Here is an exponentByRecursion.py file with the Python code:\nPython\nAnd here is the equivalent JavaScript code in exponentByRecursion.html:\nWhen you run this code, the output is identical to the iterative version:\nEach recursive call effectively cuts the problem size in half. This is what makes our recursive exponent algorithm faster than the iterative version; calculating 31000 iteratively entails 1,000 multiplication operations, while doing it recursively requires only 23 multiplications and divisions. When running the Python code under a performance profiler, calculating 31000 iteratively 100,000 times takes 10.633 seconds, but the recursive calculation takes only 0.406 seconds. That is a huge improvement!",
        "The following text is from a book on Python programming. Please point out any technical errors or inaccuracies, along with any significant grammatical mistakes. Skip on summarizing the content and just list the errors you find:\nCreating an Iterative Exponents Function Based on Recursive Insights\nOur original iterative exponents function took a straightforward approach: loop the same number of times as the exponent power. However, this doesn\u2019t scale well for larger powers. Our recursive implementation forced us to think about how to break this problem into smaller subproblems. This approach turns out to be much more efficient.\nBecause every recursive algorithm has an equivalent iterative algorithm, we could make a new iterative exponents function based on the power rule that the recursive algorithm uses. The following exponentWithPowerRule.py program has such a function:\nPython\nHere is the equivalent JavaScript program in exponentWithPowerRule.html:\nOur algorithm keeps reducing n by dividing it in half (if it\u2019s even) or subtracting 1 (if it\u2019s odd) until it is 1. This gives us the squaring or multiply-by-a operations we have to perform. After finishing this step, we perform these operations in reverse order. A generic stack data structure (separate from the call stack) is useful for reversing the order of these operations since it\u2019s a first-in, last-out data structure. The first step pushes squaring or multiply-by-a operations to a stack in the opStack variable. In the second step, it performs these operations as it pops them off the stack.\nFor example, calling exponentWithPowerRule(6, 5) to calculate 65 sets a as 6 and n as 5. The function notes that n is odd. This means we should subtract 1 from n to get 4 and push a multiply-by-a operation to opStack. Now that n is 4 (even), we divide it by 2 to get 2 and push a squaring operation to opStack. Since n is now 2 and even again, we divide it by 2 to get 1 and push another squaring operation to opStack. Now that n is 1, we are finished with this first step.\nTo perform the second step, we start the result as a (which is 6). We pop the opStack stack to get a squaring operation, telling the program to set result to result * result (that is, result2) or 36. We pop the next operation off opStack, and it is another squaring operation, so the program changes the 36 in result to 36 * 36, or 1296. We pop the last operation off opStack, and it is a multiply-by-a operation, so we multiply the 1296 in result by a (which is 6) to get 7776. There are no more operations on opStack, so the function is now finished. When we double-check our math, we find that 65 is indeed 7,776.\nThe stack in opStack looks like Figure 2-4 as the function call exponentWithPowerRule(6, 5) executes.\nFigure 2-4: The stack in opStack during the exponentWithPowerRule(6, 5) function call\nWhen you run this code, the output is identical to the other exponent programs:\nThe iterative exponents function that uses the power rule has the improved performance of the recursive algorithm, while not suffering from the risk of a stack overflow. We might not have thought of this new, improved iterative algorithm without the insights of recursive thinking.\nWhen Do You Need to Use Recursion?\nYou never need to use recursion. No programming problem requires recursion. This chapter has shown that recursion has no magical power to do things that iterative code in a loop with a stack data structure cannot do. In fact, a recursive function might be an overcomplicated solution for what you\u2019re trying to achieve.\nHowever, as the exponent functions we created in the previous section show, recursion can provide new insights into how to think about our programming problem. Three features of a programming problem, when present, make it especially suitable to a recursive approach:\nIt involves a tree-like structure.\nIt involves backtracking.\nIt isn\u2019t so deeply recursive as to potentially cause a stack overflow.\nA tree has a self-similar structure: the branching points look similar to the root of a smaller subtree. Recursion often deals with self-similarity and problems that can be divided into smaller, similar subproblems. The root of the tree is analogous to the first call to a recursive function, the branching points are analogous to recursive cases, and the leaves are analogous to the base cases where no more recursive calls are made.\nA maze is also a good example of a problem that has a tree-like structure and requires backtracking. In a maze, the branching points occur wherever you must pick one of many paths to follow. If you reach a dead end, you\u2019ve encountered the base case. You must then backtrack to a previous branching point to select a different path to follow.\nFigure 2-5 shows a maze\u2019s path visually morphed to look like a biological tree. Despite the visual difference between the maze paths and the tree-shaped paths, their branching points are related to each other in the same way. Mathematically, these graphs are equivalent.\nFigure 2-5: A maze (left) along with its interior paths (center) morphed to match a biological tree\u2019s shape (right)\nMany programming problems have this tree-like structure at their core. For example, a filesystem has a tree-like structure; the subfolders look like the root folders of a smaller filesystem. Figure 2-6 compares a filesystem to a tree.\nFigure 2-6: A filesystem is similar to a tree structure.\nSearching for a specific filename in a folder is a recursive problem: you search the folder and then recursively search the folder\u2019s subfolders. Folders with no subfolders are the base cases that cause the recursive searching to stop. If your recursive algorithm doesn\u2019t find the filename it\u2019s looking for, it backtracks to a previous parent folder and continues searching from there.\nThe third point is a matter of practicality. If your tree structure has so many levels of branches that a recursive function would cause a stack overflow before it can reach the leaves, then recursion isn\u2019t a suitable solution.\nOn the other hand, recursion is the best approach for creating programming language compilers. Compiler design is its own expansive subject and beyond the scope of this book. But programming languages have a set of grammar rules that can break source code into a tree structure similar to the way grammar rules can break English sentences into a tree diagram. Recursion is an ideal technique to apply to compilers.\nWe\u2019ll identify many recursive algorithms in this book, and they often have the tree-like structure or backtracking features that lend themselves to recursion well.\nComing Up with Recursive Algorithms\nHopefully, this chapter has given you a firm idea of how recursive functions compare to the iterative algorithms you\u2019re likely more familiar with. The rest of this book dives into the details of various recursive algorithms. But how should you go about writing your own recursive functions?\nThe first step is always to identify the recursive case and the base case. You can take a top-down approach by breaking the problem into subproblems that are similar to the original problem but smaller; this is your recursive case. Then consider when the subproblems are small enough to have a trivial answer; this is your base case. Your recursive function may have more than one recursive case or base case, but all recursive functions will always have at least one recursive case and at least one base case.\nThe recursive Fibonacci algorithm is an example. A Fibonacci number is the sum of the previous two Fibonacci numbers. We can break the problem of finding a Fibonacci number into the subproblems of finding two smaller Fibonacci numbers. We know the first two Fibonacci numbers are both 1, so that provides the base case answer once the subproblems are small enough.\nSometimes it helps to take a bottom-up approach and consider the base case first, and then see how larger and larger problems are constructed and solved from there. The recursive factorial problem is an example. The factorial of 1! is 1. This forms the base case. The next factorial is 2!, and you create it by multiplying 1! by 2. The factorial after that, 3!, is created by multiplying 2! by 3, and so on. From this general pattern, we can figure out what the recursive case for our algorithm will be.\nSummary\nIn this chapter, we covered calculating factorials and the Fibonacci sequence, two classic recursive programming problems. This chapter featured both iterative and recursive implementations for these algorithms. Despite being classic examples of recursion, their recursive algorithms suffer from critical flaws. The recursive factorial function can cause stack overflows, while the recursive Fibonacci function performs so many redundant calculations that it\u2019s far too slow to be effective in the real world.\nWe explored how to create recursive algorithms from iterative algorithms and how to create iterative algorithms from recursive algorithms. Iterative algorithms use a loop, and any recursive algorithm can be performed iteratively by using a loop and a stack data structure. Recursion is often an overly complicated solution, but programming problems that involve a tree-like structure and backtracking are particularly suitable for recursive implementations.\nWriting recursive functions is a skill that improves with practice and experience. The rest of this book covers several well-known recursion examples and explores their strengths and limitations.\nFurther Reading\nYou can find more information about comparing iteration and recursion in the Computerphile YouTube channel\u2019s video \u201cProgramming Loops vs. Recursion\u201d at https://youtu.be/HXNhEYqFo0o. If you want to compare the performance of iterative and recursive functions, you need to learn how to use a profiler. Python profilers are explained in Chapter 13 of my book Beyond the Basic Stuff with Python (No Starch Press, 2020), which can be read at https://inventwithpython.com/beyond/chapter13.html. The official Python documentation also covers profilers at https://docs.python.org/3/library/profile.html.

        "The following text is from a book on Python programming. Please point out any technical errors or inaccuracies, along with any significant grammatical mistakes. Skip on summarizing the content and just list the errors you find:\nIf you take a computer science course, the unit on recursion is sure to cover some of the classic algorithms presented in this chapter. Coding interviews (which, for lack of suitable ways to evaluate candidates, often crib notes from freshman computer science curricula) can touch upon them too. This chapter covers six classic problems in recursion, along with their solutions.\nWe begin with three simple algorithms: summing the numbers in an array, reversing a text string, and detecting whether a string is a palindrome. Then we explore an algorithm for solving the Tower of Hanoi puzzle, implement the flood fill drawing algorithm, and tackle the absurdly recursive Ackermann function.\nIn the process, you\u2019ll learn about the head-tail technique for splitting up the data in the recursive function arguments. We\u2019ll also ask ourselves three questions when trying to come up with recursive solutions: What is the base case? What argument is passed to the recursive function call? And how do the arguments passed to the recursive function calls become closer to the base case? As you gain more experience, answering these questions should come more naturally.\nSumming Numbers in an Array\nOur first example is simple: given a list (in Python) or an array (in JavaScript) of integers, return the total sum of all the integers. For example, a call such as sum([5, 2, 4, 8]) should return 19.\nThis is easy to solve with a loop, but solving it with recursion requires more thought. After reading Chapter 2, you might also notice that this algorithm doesn\u2019t map well enough to recursion\u2019s capabilities to justify recursion\u2019s added complexity. Still, summing numbers in an array (or some other calculation based on processing data in a linear data structure) is a common enough recursion problem in coding interviews that it deserves our attention.\nTo solve this problem, let\u2019s examine the head-tail technique for implementing recursive functions. This technique splits the recursive function\u2019s array argument into two parts: the head (the first element of the array) and the tail (a new array including everything after the first element). We define the recursive sum() function to find the sum of the array argument\u2019s integers by adding the head to the sum of the tail array. To find out the sum of the tail array, we recursively pass it as the array argument to sum().\nBecause the tail array is one element smaller than the original array argument, we\u2019ll eventually end up calling the recursive function and passing it an empty array. An empty array argument is trivial to sum and doesn\u2019t require more recursive calls; it is merely 0. From these facts, our answers to the three questions are as follows:\nWhat is the base case? An empty array, which has the sum of 0.\nWhat argument is passed to the recursive function call? The tail of the original number array, which has one less number than the original array argument.\nHow does this argument become closer to the base case? The array argument shrinks by one element for each recursive call until it becomes a zero-length, or empty, array.\nHere is sumHeadTail.py, a Python program to sum a list of numbers:\nPython\nAnd here is the equivalent JavaScript program, sumHeadTail.html:\nThe output of these programs is shown here:\nWhen called with an empty array argument, the base case of our function simply returns 0 \u2776. In the recursive case, we form the head \u2777 and the tail \u2778 from the original numbers argument. Keep in mind that the data type of tail is an array of numbers, just like the numbers argument. But the data type of head is just a single number value, and not an array with one number value. The return value of the sum() function is also a single number value and not an array of numbers; this is why we can add head and sum(tail) together in the recursive case \u2779.\nEach recursive call passes a smaller and smaller array to sum(), bringing it closer to the base case of an empty array. For example, Figure 3-1 shows the state of the call stack for sum([5, 2, 4, 8]).\nIn this figure, each card in the stack represents a function call. At the top of each card is the function name with the argument it was passed when called. Beneath that are the local variables: the numbers parameter, and the head and tail local variables created during the call. At the bottom of the card is the head + sum(tail) expression that the function call returns. When a new recursive function is made, a new card is pushed to the stack. When the function call returns, the top card is popped from the stack.\nFigure 3-1: The state of the call stack when sum([5, 2, 4, 8]) runs\nWe can use the sum() function as a template for applying the head-tail technique to other recursive functions. For example, you can change the sum() function from one that sums an array of numbers to a concat() function that concatenates an array of strings together. The base case would return an empty string for an empty array argument, while the recursive case would return the head string joined with the return value of the recursive call that is passed the tail.\nRecall from Chapter 2 that recursion is especially suited for problems that involve a tree-like structure and backtracking. An array, string, or other linear data structure can be considered a tree-like structure, albeit a tree that has only one branch at each node, as in Figure 3-2.\nFigure 3-2: A [5, 2, 4, 8] array (right) is like a tree data structure (left) with only one branch at each node.\nThe key \u201ctell\u201d that our recursive function is unnecessary is that it never does any backtracking over the data it processes. It makes a single pass over each element in the array from beginning to end, which is something a basic loop can accomplish. Additionally, the Python recursive summation function is about 100 times slower than a straightforward iterative algorithm. Even if performance weren\u2019t an issue, the recursive sum() function would cause a stack overflow if passed a list with tens of thousands of numbers to sum. Recursion is an advanced technique, but it isn\u2019t always the best approach.\nIn Chapter 5, we\u2019ll examine a recursive summation function that uses a divide-and-conquer strategy, and in Chapter 8 we\u2019ll examine one that uses tail call optimization. These alternate recursive approaches work around some of the problems in the summation function in this chapter.\nReversing a String\nLike summing the numbers in an array, reversing a string is another frequently cited recursive algorithm even though the iterative solution is straightforward. Because a string is essentially an array of single characters, we\u2019ll employ the head and tail approach for our rev() function just as we did for the summation algorithm.\nLet\u2019s start with the smallest strings possible. A blank string and a single-character string are already the reverse of themselves. These naturally form our base cases: if the string argument is a string such as '' or \u2032A\u2032, our function should simply return the string argument.\nFor larger strings, let\u2019s try splitting the string into a head (just the first character) and tail (all characters after the first). For a two-character string like \u2032XY\u2032, \u2032X\u2032 is the head and \u2032Y\u2032 is the tail. To reverse the string, we need to place the head behind the tail: \u2032YX\u2032.\nDoes this algorithm hold for longer strings? To reverse a string like \u2032CAT\u2032, we would break it into the head \u2032C\u2032 and the tail \u2032AT\u2032. But placing the head behind the tail alone doesn\u2019t reverse the string; it gives us \u2032ATC\u2032. What we actually want to do is put the head behind the reverse of the tail. In other words, \u2032AT\u2032 would reverse to \u2032TA\u2032, and then adding the head to the end of that would produce the reversed string, \u2032TAC\u2032.\nHow can we reverse the tail? Well, we can recursively call rev() and pass it the tail. Forget about the implementation of our function for a moment and focus on its input and output: rev() takes one string argument and returns a string with the argument\u2019s characters reversed.\nThinking about how to implement a recursive function like rev() can be difficult because it involves a chicken-and-egg problem. In order to write rev()\u2019s recursive case, we need to call a function that reverses a string\u2014that is, rev(). As long as we have a solid understanding of what our recursive function\u2019s arguments and return value will be, we can use the leap-of-faith technique to get around this chicken-and-egg problem by writing our recursive case assuming the rev() function call returns the correct value even though we haven\u2019t finished writing it yet.\nTaking a leap of faith in recursion is not a magical technique that guarantees your code works bug free. It is merely a perspective to hold to break past the mental programmer\u2019s block you can have when thinking about how to implement your recursive function. The leap of faith requires you to have a firm understanding of your recursive function\u2019s arguments and return value.\nNote that the leap-of-faith technique only helps you write the recursive case. You must pass to the recursive call an argument that is closer to the base case. You can\u2019t simply pass the same argument that the recursive function received, like this:\nTo continue our \u2032CAT\u2032 example, when we pass the tail \u2032AT\u2032 to rev(), the head is \u2032A\u2032 and the tail is \u2032T\u2032 in that function call. We already know that the reverse of a single-character string like \u2032T\u2032 is simply \u2032T\u2032; that\u2019s our base case. So this second call to rev() will reverse \u2032AT\u2032 to \u2032TA\u2032, which is precisely what the previous call to rev() needs. Figure 3-3 shows the state of the call stack during all the recursive calls to rev().\nLet\u2019s ask our three recursive algorithm questions about the rev() function:\nWhat is the base case? A zero- or one-character string.\nWhat argument is passed to the recursive function call? The tail of the original string argument, which has one less character than the original string argument.\nHow does this argument become closer to the base case? The array argument shrinks by one element for each recursive call until it becomes a one- or zero-length array.\nFigure 3-3: The state of the call stack as the rev() function reverses the CAT string\nHere is reverseString.py, a Python program to reverse a string:\nPython\nAnd here is the equivalent JavaScript code in reverseString.html:\nHere is the output of these programs:\nfedcba\nOur recursive function rev() returns the string that is the reverse of the argument, theString. Let\u2019s consider the simplest strings to reverse: the empty string and a single-character string would \u201creverse\u201d to themselves. These are the two base cases with which we\u2019ll start (though we combine them with an or or || Boolean operator \u2776). For the recursive case, we form head from the first character in theString \u2777, and tail from every character after the first \u2778. The recursive case then returns the reverse of tail followed by the head character \u2779."

Vou antes falar de umas ideias, depois dar um pouco da l\u00f3gica. \n* Eu escrevi o abaixo, passe para pt-bR mas gramaticalmente correto, estilo non-fiction, como vc percebeu. \nWhen we use things, as tools, it simply does not make any sense to judge the tool, not in real-time as you are using it. A distortion in my mind s operating system probably compels me to always judge things. I know, it it a problem. \nSo we accept, for the sake of being and living in this society, that things are the things we have in front of us. Back in the 1700s, back in Oliver Evans days when he was a kid, he had the chance to see wheels, as he grew up as an apprentice of a wheelwright. \nLooking at the river flowing, looking at the animals of the farmers, being used to flow a system of trade, he had to accept that certain things were what they were. Well, not he, not the young Oliver Evans. I will get to that point but now, for now, let's just focus in our natural ability to be pragmatic, to use systems, to find out way around by accepting the systems and tools, perhaps in many cases modifying them. But for many of us, not totally having time, or being in a position, to modify the tool. \nWhen we are not masters, experts, in front of a tool, we tend to out ourselves in the position of being subordinate to that. Well, it's not new. The master, teaching to you, knows more. It is probably part of our biology, our brains, our natural instinct and operating reality - that we put ourselves almost in a position of being a learner. I say that because a learner, an apprentice, can be a subordinate but it is accepting incoming new data, learning. \nBut for a lot of new things that we do in our modern world, the subordinate role is there in front of a tool, but now the apprentice role. That also supported by the fact that you have no master in front of you. You seem to be in your world. \nConsider how many people have sub utilized a scientific calculator. The calculator itself can't help you. \nSo we arrive at the door of where I wanted us to reflect. In front of tools, and systems, of our modern world, we are stuck, alone. Using our own ways to deal with these tools, eventually trying to figure a thing or another, we are being the subordinate role but we are not engaging in the apprentice role. A life with no masters and eventually, through collaboration, if you are lucky to collaborate with a tool between you the your colleagues, then yes perhaps you would have better chances to learn. \nLet's zoom in in what is an operating window of a popular operating system that was created in end of the 1900s by the entrepreneur know as Bill Gates. \nHe had helped to popularize the computer using a system and method known as the operating system. The main thing a normal person would see, in front of what came to be know as personal computers, is what the industry have named, the user interface. Now, if we go back in time to the days of the typewriter, and consider the emergence of the first personal computers that seemed to have some resemblance with type writers, we would find ourselves in a complex place to grasp. Yes, you would assume that it could be used to type text, such as an article. But the fact that you can see your text inside a window, a digital window that shows a visual representation of a page? Well, my friend, that is tricky, and new. Mainly as you instantly figure that you can throw away the page if you want, without the necessity to use paper. And better, that you can edit the paragraph. Erasing a character seems amazing. \nNow, that is just one small thing of an operating system as the user would be trying to understand a text editor. \nAlthough one could find their way in front of a user interface, a curious person, the new world of possibilities of the digital systems, the system interfaces, have created a complexity that puts the user in the subordinate position, of not knowing really how to use the tool, not entirely. This situation is not so different from the situations of a young boy in the farm in the 1700s that would not know exactly how to use a hammer. He likely need to learn with a master. Likely he has a master. Actually the very world master carries a duality in the situation. He was likely learning but also likely serving the master. \nBut back to the modern world of digital systems, we have no mentors and these tools can do a lot for us, already. Most tools are also designed with an intention of being simple. In other words, they invite the user at all times. \nSo, in a way, we know we can use a system though its user interface. We know partially how to use. We are invited to use. But we can't exactly cross the barrier to judge for a perhaps a few reasons such as the fact that we are likely using the tool because we need for something, thus pausing to learn is not in alignment with the goal. A related aspect of that is that the consideration of something new to be there, something to judge, something to learn, triggers the overwhelming possibility, the blank canvas effect. All the possible extras here are likely something that demands us to be in the apprentice mode, to have a proper mentor that would know our interest and need, the local need. And it's not entirely our fault that we won't have the inclination to seek things when we are doing things. We know that because the universe of things that digital systems offer is not curated by the one next to us, the one that would take care of us, that would know our goals. So we fear that we could be teased into a feature that us just a trap. So there is that. \nAnother element that we feel, in front of user interfaces of digital systems, and assuming that condition of the one that has decided to not engage in being a master of the tool, and that is inclined to use part of the tool, is the natural responded of being in the position of acceptance. Therefore, we don't become subordinate for all that the tool tell us, because we like to accept. It turns out that we have engaged with the tool with a prior mindset of being there to solve. We have our means to try to find workarounds, say in front of potential problems; but we won't be in a position of digging too much. \nThis position puts us in a mindset of accepting the subset of what we see, and use, as the reality. In addition, the systems also communicate, which is a strong element for any user. User interfaces written by software developers and their product people, are intended to put the user in the position to move forward. Yes, some of them have little boxes where you can inform a potential bug but the general idea of a good user interface follows from the premise that a good user interface should not be perceived by the user, as in it puts the user closer to solving the problem. A good ideal, for sure. \nSo the user feels to be in a certain mindset if accepting, part of the story. In addition, the user also gets straight messages from the modem user interfaces, messages that are assertive. Although we sometimes have the hint that there is a matrix behind these systems, when users have reported seen the blue screen of death, or a java error for example - see figure x. Although that, the actual formal messages never really reveal what is totally going on, possible alternate routes, their flaws. Right, as designed, not to be weak,  not to put the user in a position to modify, to change, to judge. \nA common situation that I keep seeing in Brazil as we have a white developed digital payments systems when you go local and want to pay. The \"card processing\" machines never ever shown an error. They give all sorts of messages that many people go though. Invalid card, problems with the magnetic, try again, insufficient funds, transaction denied, and a lot more. I can't count the many times that I went through that situation and had a feeling that I had a problem in my bank or with my card. Somehow is always on me. And it is worse because if it crosses your mind, for a micro second, the possibility of being the system, that idea is vanished right away as you look at the operator and their face. They also support that idea. I even hard times with operators as they were certain it was a problem with my card. Yes, I confess, in a few occasions I didn't have money. But it is so sad to think the amount of people that feel bad for these messages, as they feel partly responsible. \nAs a software developer by background, i have to believe that the people that work with these systems have jobs, that they are still working. It is natural for me to even consider that some of these systems are sometimes full of requests to a point that they fail, such as specially during the hush ours, lunch time for example. \nBut no, never, I have never seen a message saying: apologies dear user, our system is resting now, or our system is digesting, or our system is being updated, or we have bugs. \nSo, going back to us in front of user interfaces? We trust too much that tool that we are not experts, that we partly use. We are subordinates to the experience. It's me, it is the way it is. \nThese other element of communication in tools is not only a projection that sets us in a mindset due to messages.

        "Passe somente a parte abaixo para en-US : \nAlthough one could find their way in front of a user interface, a curious person, the new world of possibilities of the digital systems, the system interfaces, have created a complexity that puts the user in the subordinate position, of not knowing really how to use the tool, not entirely. This situation is not so different from the situations of a young boy in the farm in the 1700s that would not know exactly how to use a hammer. He likely need to learn with a master. Likely he has a master. Actually the very world master carries a duality in the situation. He was likely learning but also likely serving the master. \nBut back to the modern world of digital systems, we have no mentors and these tools can do a lot for us, already. Most tools are also designed with an intention of being simple. In other words, they invite the user at all times. \nSo, in a way, we know we can use a system though its user interface. We know partially how to use. We are invited to use. But we can't exactly cross the barrier to judge for a perhaps a few reasons such as the fact that we are likely using the tool because we need for something, thus pausing to learn is not in alignment with the goal. A related aspect of that is that the consideration of something new to be there, something to judge, something to learn, triggers the overwhelming possibility, the blank canvas effect. All the possible extras here are likely something that demands us to be in the apprentice mode, to have a proper mentor that would know our interest and need, the local need. And it's not entirely our fault that we won't have the inclination to seek things when we are doing things. We know that because the universe of things that digital systems offer is not curated by the one next to us, the one that would take care of us, that would know our goals. So we fear that we could be teased into a feature that us just a trap. So there is that. \nAnother element that we feel, in front of user interfaces of digital systems, and assuming that condition of the one that has decided to not engage in being a master of the tool, and that is inclined to use part of the tool, is the natural responded of being in the position of acceptance. Therefore, we don't become subordinate for all that the tool tell us, because we like to accept. It turns out that we have engaged with the tool with a prior mindset of being there to solve. We have our means to try to find workarounds, say in front of potential problems; but we won't be in a position of digging too much. \nThis position puts us in a mindset of accepting the subset of what we see, and use, as the reality. In addition, the systems also communicate, which is a strong element for any user. User interfaces written by software developers and their product people, are intended to put the user in the position to move forward. Yes, some of them have little boxes where you can inform a potential bug but the general idea of a good user interface follows from the premise that a good user interface should not be perceived by the user, as in it puts the user closer to solving the problem. A good ideal, for sure. \nSo the user feels to be in a certain mindset if accepting, part of the story. In addition, the user also gets straight messages from the modem user interfaces, messages that are assertive. Although we sometimes have the hint that there is a matrix behind these systems, when users have reported seen the blue screen of death, or a java error for example - see figure x. Although that, the actual formal messages never really reveal what is totally going on, possible alternate routes, their flaws. Right, as designed, not to be weak,  not to put the user in a position to modify, to change, to judge. \nA common situation that I keep seeing in Brazil as we have a white developed digital payments systems when you go local and want to pay. The \"card processing\" machines never ever shown an error. They give all sorts of messages that many people go though. Invalid card, problems with the magnetic, try again, insufficient funds, transaction denied, and a lot more. I can't count the many times that I went through that situation and had a feeling that I had a problem in my bank or with my card. Somehow is always on me. And it is worse because if it crosses your mind, for a micro second, the possibility of being the system, that idea is vanished right away as you look at the operator and their face. They also support that idea. I even hard times with operators as they were certain it was a problem with my card. Yes, I confess, in a few occasions I didn't have money. But it is so sad to think the amount of people that feel bad for these messages, as they feel partly responsible. \nAs a software developer by background, i have to believe that the people that work with these systems have jobs, that they are still working. It is natural for me to even consider that some of these systems are sometimes full of requests to a point that they fail, such as specially during the hush ours, lunch time for example. \nBut no, never, I have never seen a message saying: apologies dear user, our system is resting now, or our system is digesting, or our system is being updated, or we have bugs. \nSo, going back to us in front of user interfaces? We trust too much that tool that we are not experts, that we partly use. We are subordinates to the experience.

        "I will paste my text, fix English william zinsser influenced style, plain business english or objective. Thjis is for my about entitled Slow Down to Win, about deceleration. And the chapter will be on part 3, about how we discover collaboration with tools and systems, and people. \nChat gpt was released, and before I could see it's value I caught myself using it to ideate texts. I caught myself saying - that the tool was amazing the more senior you are. As being senior in some subjects help us to quickly provoke chatGpt, change its directions. Also it might be the case that I am a learner that learns via writing. And then I caught myself writing. \nBut then there are certain things that have nothing really to do with the technology that is behind and have to do with the experience of interaction with the tool, how I am using the tool, that seem to be teaching me a lesson about humans and productivity, how we collaborate, how for some people emotions and thoughts can be on your way to prevent a good work session that can lead to a good work material. \nHere are some things I have discovered from using chatGpt that seem to be more on my end of it, less to do with chatGpt. \nBut before I break in sessions I have to accept, and recognize, the fact that there is a motivation that brought me in front of chatGpt. That I gave myself a chance to interact with it, due to something. And the something is, as anyone would naturally guess, the promise, the prize. As in, of I tell what I want,then it comes the prize. That simple idea is an element that this article wants to put in the podium, if I had to select a winner, the attention that we can give to anything, when we are interested. Some professors are good in articulating the reasons for their student to pay attention. \nMaybe as for myself for believing in what chatGpt could do, It may have to do with my background, since I have a computer science background and started playing with computers at the age of 10. \nI sort of wasn't expecting that technology could do that sort of thing, to use the narratives available to sort of act and produce results comparable with reasoning. As in, to be able to say something in a poor way and to see the machine producing the exact result I was aiming for. So as I touched in it, I felt the potential, it understood me, in a way. \nAnd this observation brings us to these observations about the things we humans have started to fail, perhaps due to our urgent way of operating in life. \nMany people know that line, across entrepreneurs, the elevator pitch. You have 30 seconds to call the attention of an investor. It's a filter that they do, a test, as article xxx explores. It's also a selection system, as we have seen in you article about accelerators and investors and risk filtering systems. So then, as we know, we can t use the time with the investor to start with \"when I was born\" or any sort of deductive say or saying things. We have also seen in kkk that using time to reverse the deductive logic to the point of structuring the logic, is the way to go for investors, and perhaps even for communication in your family. \nWhich brings us to, your friend also will not have the time to get what you are saying. Not anymore. It's not their fault. It is in how we grasp information, plus of course the urgencies. \nSo, you are left with yourself. Go back home, try to achieve clarity of ideas, then come back. Well, now chatgpt won't give up on you. You can even test, by giving out bits and pieces, tell it your story, eventually make the points, and interate. If you are trying to use the other to achieve clarity, chatgpt can help. Or course, that works because its technology produces things that you can read,.leading you to achieve more clarity, to course correct, and more. \nWhat it produces can be read. Unlike what you probably wrote. And it also provides structure, explanations. And also it, as of the version 4, type words by words. \nAnd also, it does not have ads. Do you see where I am going? I was able to read, I am able to read. The conversation approach, and the simple UI that flows, pulls me to follow the flow. \nA well commented phenomenon has to do with prompts, which is not new in the world as we knew it. The science and art of making prompts resonates with the art and science of working in question. There is a whole world about that, such as documented in books such as the most beautiful question. \nAnd now, chatGpt has unlocked, the world of prompts. There are even ai thingd and business focusing in prompts. \nBut then, right in front of us an opportunity unlocked by these tools. That it pulls us to work in our prompts. That is point a. And point b resonates with what I read from Julia Cameron in The Right to Write. She said that if you give up your critic that asks you to write properly, then you can unlock yourself. My awakening about a feature of chatgpt came out from the thing Julia said. Since I came back to write this book, So then, somehow when I did Julia exercise I caught myself flowing well, and stumbled at what she said it would happen. That the Release if writing right unlocked me. And the synchronicity that I felt with using chatGpt, that I was making developing well the prompts and feeling that I had nailed it. by bring motivated to write, and not worrying much about grammar or the judge, I caught myself accessing what I wanted to say and coordinating better the thoughts. \nActually my discovery before Julia's reading was a day that I noticed that I did such a good job in elaborating a prompt narrative that I didn't need to send to chatGpt. I didn't send. And that was it. \nAnd the exercise that Julia asked me, not so different. Write without worrying, unlocks. \nI should remark That what I am referring to might not be exactly the same thing that many people write and do related to the art of prompts, the science of prompts. I might have started to develop my approach to prompts more like in a narrative approach, as of I was explaining to a buddy with lots of patience. I might have caught myself exercising too my approach to learning - is what I felt as I read a section from 777 homo narrans."

        "* I had an idea for my book about entrepreneurship and urgency, actually the title is Slow down to Win. \n* This idea, for one of the articles, came from a situation that I saw: my wife, a psychologist, has a room which she rents in a space where many other health professionals share. They are not part of a company but they share the space of the building and what it takes so that they can help their customers. \n* One situation, which they have in common, is to take care of the security of the building. They have an alarm and a sort of logic for setting the alarm which Vanessa was sort of learning. They don't have super clear rules, so they sort of communicate using a WhatsApp group. Vanessa was getting used to the rules and came across a process, she learned the hard way. It turns out that the last to leave the building has to check a few doors and set the alarm. Vanessa didn't exactly know that she was the last so she assume she wasn't and didn't check the alarm. The problem was identified by others and some of the members were mad, even pointed that it was a lack of responsibility. Thus, the complication, some principles were there but the rules were not that strict, and they had to find their ways. Also, no formal onboarding for any of the new members. \n* Anyhow, solutions seem to arise, out of real experience which is good. A case came up. From the discussion, and motivated to improve the rules and systems, one of the professionals proposed a technological solution which he promoted as good and simple. He asked one of his employees to make a software.\nA software to help the professionals to signal when their left their rooms. One of the characteristics of any good technological contributions is, of course, to be simple. Thus, it was created overnight a simple solution. He presented the solution, with the message that was his willingness to help, he also pointed that he mobilized his employee to do. Now, that message was communicated. And what were the reaction of the group? Only support, of course. It was a sign of help, support. Their system consisted of a web page with boxes, from 1 to 24 and no password needed. It was a system to be used by the members and would depend on support. In other words, each professional would need to tap on their square to change from red to green. Red meaning that the room is busy and green that is empty. With that, when all the boxes where green except you, it means you are the last person and you are responsible for checking all systems and setting the alarm.\n* Resolution? Now all sorts of problems are happening but there is simply no communication around anymore. From technical problems related to the use of the UI, to adherence of usage yes or no, to possible failures in the system, to misuse. It is as if the solution might have created a space that it would be not possible to bring up the possibility that the solution was bad and didn't help. Some of the professionals don't want to be subordinate to that web page requirement, to have mobile phone ready and data plan available. Others may have mistyped other boxes and would not bring up as they fear or would be ashamed. Others would not bring up the requests to fix the system as if they featured that the system would become complex and it was, after all, a support and contribution. No room to say straight that the system didn't work. \n* But then, and the point of this article is when you have a proposal for a system addition that finds its way as it projects that the support was an aid, and that it was made with love or caring. How would one object to that? In their case, even worse, the employee of the professional used extra time. So it is as if they were doing q favor, complex. \nIt is also compelling, anything that has to do with technology. Because technology itself is meant to help. Also, some people work with technology and they are the ones that need to be included.\nNow with this intro, make an article following an outline like this, an intro with SCqA> Situation being the fact that people have good intentions and they use the technology at their hands to help. And that amid problems they face, they sometimes promote their technology contributions as free in an effort to collaborate; and  that when pressured by friendlyness, and positiveness, the group might in many situations be forced to agree with the technology introduction which is the complication. In terms of q- what happens, we can present the case. ",

I want you highlight the point like what is the difference between UIKit and SwiftUI, in terms of State and Data Flows?  and I want you add  @State, @Binding, @ObservedObject, @StateObject, and @EnvironmentObject in the answer.\n- Centralized: Lifecycle methods are located within a single `UIViewController` or `UIView`.\n- Controlled: The developer primarily controls the lifecycle, including when and how views are created, updated, and destroyed.\n- Imperative: You explicitly define what should happen at each stage of the lifecycle. This includes creating views, updating them, laying them out, and handling transitions.\n- Limited Triggers: Lifecycle methods are triggered a limited number of times based on the view's lifecycle events. For example, `viewDidLoad()` is called once after the view is loaded into memory.\n- Initializer: `init()` is part of the lifecycle, but view hierarchy dependent setup is usually done in `viewDidLoad()`, as the view isn't guaranteed to be loaded in `init()`.\n- Distributed: Views are struct value types that are cheap to create and can be destroyed and recreated frequently in response to state changes.\n- Managed: The SwiftUI framework primarily handles the lifecycle of views. It decides when to draw, update, and discard views based on the current state.\n- Declarative: You define what the UI should look like for a given state, and SwiftUI automatically updates the UI when the state changes. \n- Frequent Triggers: Lifecycle events like `.onAppear()` and `.onDisappear()` can be triggered multiple times as views appear and disappear. They are about when a view gets drawn or removed from the view hierarchy.\n- Initializer: `init()` is used for initial setup, but it's not directly tied to the view lifecycle like in UIKit. `init()` may be called multiple times as views are recreated in response to state changes.\nYou have captured the main differences quite well. The primary takeaways are the shift from an imperative to a declarative paradigm, the way views are managed and updated in response to state changes, and the difference in how and when lifecycle methods are called.",

        "Asses my Research Plan to Tackle uncertainty under the Vectoring in Research framework/methodology\nYou are a top research expert, professor at Stanford giving feedback to make a research plan excellent. \nYou are using the \"Vectoring in Research\" framework/methodology to asses the research plan. \nIn particular, with emphasis in identifying the most impactful/important research goal with future actions to that are \nmost direct in attaining that goal -- while minimizing/identifying potential risks, assumptions and uncertainties. \nIn more detail, this is the vectoring methodology: \nVectoring is an iterative process used in research to identify and focus on the most critical aspect, or \"dimension of risk,\" in a project at a given time. This critical aspect is called a \"vector.\"\nThe goal of vectoring is to manage and reduce risk and uncertainty. \nInstead of trying to solve all aspects of a problem simultaneously, researchers pick one vector (dimension of uncertainty) \nand focus on reducing its risk and uncertainty within a short time frame, typically 1-2 weeks.\nThe concept advocates an iterative approach, where after one vector's risk is mitigated, new vectors (risks or uncertainties) might emerge. Then, the process of vectoring is repeated for the new vector. This continuous re-vectoring allows researchers to keep honing the core insights of the research project.\nThe vectoring process involves generating and ranking questions based on their criticality, then rapidly answering the most critical question. \nThis approach is often supplemented by assumption mapping, which is a strategy for articulating and ranking questions based on their importance and the level of known information.\nIn summary, Vectoring in Research is a method to manage complexity and risk in research projects by focusing on the most significant risks or uncertainties, \nreducing them, and then moving on to the next most important risk or uncertainty, in a continuous iterative process.\nThe goal is to move in the direction of the most essential goal or even refining the goal itself if critical\ninformation is learned in the vectoring iterative process.\nNow I will try to identify a few potential actions with their assumptions (uncertainties) asess it under the vectoring framework. \nThis is the format: \n\t- EssG: sanity check, validate/falsify that evaporate does indeed work to create a data frame for my theorems & proofs on my dummy latex textbook\n\t- Ac0: simplest action is to roll back to the version of evaporate and test that directly without modifications, only the correct pip installations I was missing\n\t\t- Ass0: I'm assuming their code actually works when they wrote the paper with their data. If this isn't true I need to write to Simran directly again\n\t- Ac1: if prev works then do it on my data\n\t- Ac2: if it doesn't work, then implement my own version of evaporate specialized for theorem proving. First direct evaporate so using an LLM then the evaporate code and evaporate code+ is the hardest (idk if worth it, perhaps direct is fine, it's a one time cost per textbook and then if we need a larger more scalable version we can do evaproate code?)\n\t\t- Ass2: unknown if evaporate direct vs e code or e code + is hard to do...\n\t\t- Ac0 is the decision because it's the most direct way to sanity check if evaporate works. I'm assuming that if it does work it will work for my use case since it's a very similar scenario and LLMs are robust + evaporate is research done at Stanford.\nNow I will recall vectoring in once sentence before I request for feedback on my research plan:\nVectoring in research is the targeted reduction of uncertainty in the direction of project's most impactful aspect/goal.\nNow give me excellent yet concise feedback on my research plan under the vectoring methodology. \nYour feedback should increase the chances I succeed in learning about my most essential research goal. \nIf you identify a potential blind spot (e.g., unknown unknowns) that might cause a failure or waste my time, mention them. \nBut also remember that unknown unknowns are by definition unpredictable, so if you can't identify those blind spots then\nmake sure the plan is adaptable, flexible and robust.\nAlso feel free to suggest sanity checks to validate my starting point \ne.g., it's good to test and validate the approach on a small sample first before committing fully due to the uncertainties. \nIf the decision to take is already excellent under the vectoring methodology you can say why and confirm it's good. \nProvide helpful excellent feedback according to the specifications:"

Just receive and acknowledge as \"Part 1/2 received\" and wait for the next part.\nIntroduction There are numerous surveys available to usability practitioners to aid them in assessing the usability of a product or service. Many of these surveys are used to evaluate specific types of interfaces, while others can be used to evaluate a wider range of interface types. The System Usability Scale (SUS) (Brooke, 1996) is one of the surveys that can be used to assess the usability of a variety of products or services. There are several characteristics of the SUS that makes its use attractive. First, it is composed of only ten statements, so it is relatively quick and easy for study participants to complete and for administrators to score. Second, it is nonproprietary, so it is cost effective to use and can be scored very quickly, immediately after completion. Third, the SUS is technology agnostic, which means that it can be used by a broad group of usability practitioners to evaluate almost any type of user interface, including Web sites, cell phones, interactive voice response (IVR) systems (both touch-tone and speech), TV applications, and more. Lastly, the result of the survey is a single score, ranging from 0 to 100, and is relatively easy to understand by a wide range of people from other disciplines who work on project teams. Bangor, Kortum, and Miller (2008) described the results of 2,324 SUS surveys from 206 usability tests collected over a ten year period. In that study, it was found that the SUS was highly reliable (alpha = 0.91) and useful over a wide range of interface types. The study also concluded that while there was a small, significant correlation between age and SUS scores (SUS scores decreasing with increasing age), there was no effect of gender. Further, it was confirmed that the SUS was predictive of impacts of changes to the user interface on usability when multiple changes to a single product were made over a large number of iterations. Other researchers have also found that the SUS is a compact and effective instrument for measuring usability. Tullis and Stetson (2004) measured the usability of two Web sites using five different surveys (including the Questionnaire for User Interaction Satisfaction [QUIS], the SUS, the Computer System Usability Questionnaire [CSUQ], and two vendor specific surveys) and found that the SUS provided the most reliable results across a wide range of sample sizes. One of the unanswered questions from previous research has been the meaning of a specific SUS score in describing a product\u201fs usability. Is a score of 50 sufficient to say that a product is usable, or is a score of 75 or 100 required? Over the course of the 10 year study reported by Bangor, Kortum, and Miller an anecdotal pattern in the test scores had begun to emerge that equated quite well with letter grades given at most major universities. The concept of applying a letter grade to the usability of the product was appealing because it is familiar to most of the people who work on design teams regardless of their discipline. Having an easy-to-understand, familiar reference point that can be easily understood by engineers and project managers facilitates the communication of the results of testing. Like the standard letter grade scale, products that scored in the 90s were exceptional, products that scored in the 80s were good, and products that scored in the 70s were acceptable. Anything below a 70 had usability issues that were cause for concern. While this concept was intuitive, we believed that a validated scale in which the usability of a product could be assigned an adjective description might be even more useful. Bangor, Kortum, and Miller reported the results of a pilot study that sought to map descriptive adjectives (e.g., good, awful, etc.) to the range of SUS scores. This paper presents the final results of that study. Methods The SUS is composed of ten statements, each having a five-point scale that ranges from Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree. There are five positive statements and five negative statements, which alternate. While the SUS has been demonstrated to be fundamentally sound, our group found that some small changes helped participants complete the SUS. First, a short set of instructions were added that reminded them to mark a response to every statement and not to dwell too long on any one statement. Second, the term cumbersome in the original Statement 8 was replaced with awkward. (This same change was independently made by Finstad, 2006.) Finally, the term system was changed to product, based on participant feedback. The current SUS form being used in our laboratories is shown in Figure 1\n116 Journal of Usability Studies Vol. 4, Issue 3, May 2009 Please check the box that reflects your immediate response to each statement.

Our current version of the System Usability Scale (SUS), showing the minor modifications to the original Brookes instrument We have used this version of the SUS in almost all of the surveys we have conducted, which to date is nearly 3,500 surveys within 273 studies. It has proven to be a robust tool, having been used many times to evaluate a wide range of interfaces that include Web sites, cell phones, IVR, GUI, hardware, and TV user interfaces. In all of these cases, participants performed a representative sample of tasks for the product (usually in formative usability tests) and then, before any discussion with the moderator, completed the survey.

It is slightly lower than the median score of 70.5, which reflects the negative skew to the set of study mean scores. In fact, fewer than 5% of all studies have a mean score of below 50 (although 18% of surveys fall below a score of 50). The quartile breakdown of study mean scores is shown in Table 2. Table 2.

However, one question that is often asked by project team members, as well as other usability practitioners, remains: \u201cWhat is the absolute usability associated with any individual SUS score?\u201d In order to help answer this question, a study was conducted that added an eleventh question to the SUS. However, instead of following the SUS format, a seven-point, adjective-anchored Likert scale was used to determine if a word or phrase could be associated with a small range of SUS scores. A subjective image quality rating scale (Bangor, 2000; Olacsi, 1998) was adapted, with the terms Marginal and Passable dropped as being too similar to OK for the diverse user population that participate in our studies. The phrasing of the prompt has three components. First, it preserves the overall wording from the original rating scale. Second, it uses the term user-friendliness because it is a widely known synonym for the concept of usability. Finally, the term product is used consistently with our version of the SUS. Figure 2 shows the adjective rating scale. 11. Overall, I would rate the user-friendliness of this product as: \uf0a8\uf0a8\uf0a8\uf0a8\uf0a8\uf0a8\uf0a8 Worst Imaginable Awful Poor OK Good Excellent Best Imaginable Figure 2. The adjective rating scale added to the SUS. Procedure The adjective rating scale statement was added at the bottom of the same page as the SUS and participants filled it out immediately after they gave their SUS ratings. The SUS with the added adjective scale was administered to 964 participants. It was used in the same wide range of studies as the SUS data reported by Bangor, Kortum, and Miller (2008), including all of the user interface modalities, across a wide age range (Mean=40.4, SD=13.9, Range: 18-81 years) and an approximately equal balance of gender (Female=474, Male=490). The modified SUS wa\n118 Journal of Usability Studies Vol. 4, Issue 3, May 2009 used in all studies in which we would have normally administered the SUS during this data collection period. Results For analysis, numerical equivalents of 1 through 7 were assigned to the adjectives from Worst Imaginable to Best Imaginable, respectively. First, a correlational analysis was conducted to determine how well the ratings (using the adjective rating scale) matched the corresponding SUS scores given by participants (i.e., via their ten individual ratings). Results are highly significant (\u03b1<0.01) with r=0.822. These results are consistent with the results found in our pilot study (Bangor, Kortum, & Miller, 2008). In the pilot study, 212 surveys were used and a correlation of r=0.806 was found between the SUS score and an identical adjective rating scale. This correlation was viewed with some caution at the time however, because only a few of the interface modes were included in the data set and there was a marked lack of data points at the extreme ends of the adjective rating scale. The mean score for each adjective rating for the current study is listed in Table 3 and show in Figure 3. Table 3.

Mean SUS score ratings corresponding to the seven adjective ratings (error bars +/one standard error of the mean) Discussion The finding that the adjective rating scale very closely matches the SUS scale suggests that it is a useful tool in helping to provide a subjective label for an individual study\u201fs mean SUS score. Given the strength of the correlation, it may be tempting to think about using the single question adjective rating alone, in place of the SUS. Certainly administration of a single item instrument would be more efficient, and the result would be an easy to interpret metric that could be quickly shared within the product team. However, there are several reasons why using a single item scale alone may not be the best course. First, in the absence of objective measures, like task success rates or time-on-task measures, we cannot adequately determine whether the SUS or the adjective rating scale is the more accurate metric. Indeed, anecdotal evidence in our lab suggests that a test participant may provide a favorable SUS score, yet fail to complete the tasks being tested. The reverse has also been observed. Collecting this kind of corroborating data is an effort that we will be undertaking in future studies. Second, psychometric theory suggests that multiple questions are generally superior to a single question. Many studies have found that multiple question surveys tend to yield more reliable results than single question surveys. For example, in a study of overall job satisfaction, Oshagbemi (1999) found that single item measures tended to produce a higher score on job satisfaction than did the comparable multi-question surveys. Because specific elements of dissatisfaction could not be uniquely addressed, the single question survey tended to dilute dissatisfaction measures. In another study, users were asked to determine their intake of fish products. In one survey, respondents were asked to estimate intake for 71 different fish items, and in another survey they were asked a single question regarding their intake of fish. The results showed that when respondents used the single question survey they underestimated their intake of fish by approximately 50% (Mina, Fritschi, & Knuiman, 2007). These studies seem to indicate the superiority of multiple item questionnaires. Other research, however, indicates that single item surveys can produce results similar to those found with multiple item surveys. For example in a study that measured workers focus of attention while on the job it was found that there were no differences between single an\n120 Journal of Usability Studies Vol. 4, Issue 3, May 2009 multiple measures (Gardner, Cummings, Dunham, & Pierce, 1998). Similarly, Bergkvist and Rossiter (2007) found that the correlation between consumers\u201f attitudes towards specific brands and advertisements was the same regardless of whether single or multiple item questionnaires were used. Based on these disparate results, how do we determine whether using the adjective rating scale alone might be appropriate? The key lies in trying to understand whether the construct of usability is a concrete singular object as defined by Rossiter (2002). In order for a construct to be concrete, all of the users must understand what object is being rated. In the case of the usability studies that is a reasonable assumption, because a single item was presented to the user for evaluation. In order for an object to be considered singular, it must be considered homogenous\u2014a single item rather than a collection of separate but related items. If an item is considered to be concrete singular, then single item questionnaires can be utilized. Howev\nRemember not answering yet. Just acknowledge you received this part with the message \"Part 1/2 received\" and wait for the next part.",
        "er, if an item is not considered to be concrete singular, then multiple item questionnaires should be utilized. Because different parts of an interface may be judged differently (e.g., the main navigation vs. the help system), we believe that the items tested as part of usability assessments are not necessarily singular. Because we assume that the interfaces are not always singular, as defined by Rossiter (2002), the non-singular nature of the item makes using only a single item questionnaire alone inadvisable. Another note of caution regarding the single adjective scale is the observation that OK might be too variable for use in this context. In this study, OK had the highest variance of the seven adjectives. It is striking, though, that its mean score (50.9 out of 100) is at the SUS scale\u201fs mid-point, which matches previous research on adjective ratings (Babbitt & Nystrom, 1989), that lists OK as being a mid-point value between Neutral and Average. However, participants may have believed OK to mean that something is acceptable. In fact, some project team members have taken a score of OK to mean that the usability of the product is satisfactory and no improvements are needed, when scores within the OK range were clearly deficient in terms of perceived usability. It seems clear that the term OK is probably not appropriate for this adjective rating scale. Not only is its meaning too variable, but it may also give the intended audience for SUS scores a mistaken impression that an OK score is satisfactory in some way. Using other, established rating scales (Babbitt & Nystrom, 1989), we believe that the terms fair or so-so are likely to still result in a mid-point value on the scale, while at the same time appropriately connoting an overall level of usability that is not acceptable in some way. Because of the questions about how accurately the actual adjectives map to SUS scores, we are also considering testing a different adjective scale. As described earlier, we have found that a useful analog to convey a study\u201fs mean SUS score to others involved in the product development process has been the traditional school grading scale (i.e., 90-100 = A, 80-89 = B, etc.) (Bangor, Kortum, & Miller, 2008). This has strong face validity for our existing data insofar as a score of 70 has traditionally meant passing, and our data show that the average study mean is about 70. We had earlier proposed a set of acceptability ranges (Bangor, Kortum, & Miller, 2008) that would help practitioners determine if a given SUS score indicated an acceptable interface or not. The grading scale matches quite well with these acceptability scores as well. Figure 4 shows how the adjective ratings compare to both the school grading scale and the acceptability ranges\n121 Journal of Usability Studies Vol. 4, Issue 3, May 2009 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 EXCELLENT GOOD OK POOR BEST IMAGINABLE WORST IMAGINABLE ACCEPTABILITY RANGES ADJECTIVE RATINGS ACCEPTABLE NOT ACCEPTABLE MARGINAL LOW HIGH SUS Score A B C D F GRADE SCALE Figure 4. A comparison of the adjective ratings, acceptability scores, and school grading scales, in relation to the average SUS score Finally, regardless of whether words or letter grades are used for such a scale, we believe that the results from a single score should be considered to be complementary to the SUS score and the results should be used together to create a clearer picture of the products overall usability. The work presented here suggests several lines of future research that are needed in order to further understand both the SUS and the use of an additional single question rating scale. First and foremost, data collection will continue with the substitution of the mid-point adjective with one that carries a stronger neutral connotation than the current term of OK. With this substitution, we will also be including a letter grade scale to allow the users themselves to make the determination of a grade assignment, rather than having to rely on the anecdotal evidence presented to date. One virtue of the letter grade approach is that the subject could be asked verbally to assign a letter grade prior to presentation of the SUS. This would help remove the letter grade from the context of the SUS questions and perhaps increase the degree of independence between the two measures. We hypothesize that users may be less reluctant to give low or failing grades to poor interfaces because of their extensive exposure to this familiar scale in other domains. We believe that users may have self-generated reference points across the entire letter grade scale and because of their previous exposures could be more willing to use the full scale. If this is true, it may prove to be a valuable extension of the SUS and help solve the range restriction issue that is prevalent in SUS scores. If the letter grade score does indeed prove to be reliable and useful, further investigations will need to focus on whether such a single score assessment might be sufficient. One important element of these investigations will be to examine the relationship between the SUS, the seven-point adjective rating scale, and the letter grade scale with objective measures of usability such as time-on-task and task success rates\n122 Journal of Usability Studies Vol. 4, Issue 3, May 2009 Practitioner\u2019s Take Away This research examined the addition of an adjective rating scale to the System Usability Scale (SUS) and found the following: \uf0b7 The SUS is an effective, reliable tool for measuring the usability of a wide variety of products and services. \uf0b7 The 0 to 100 scale is intuitive to understand, yet raises many questions about what a single SUS score means in an absolute sense. \uf0b7 Analysis of nearly 1,000 SUS scores has shown that an adjective rating is highly correlated with SUS scores. \uf0b7 The addition of an adjective rating scale to the SUS can help practitioners interpret individual SUS scores, and aid in explaining the results to non-human factors professionals. \uf0b7 The SUS score associated with the mid-point adjective of OK is consistent with previous adjective rating scale research, but the connotation of OK may suggest an acceptable product. We present alternative adjectives that have similar ratings but that suggest a more accurate connotation of the product\u201fs actual usability. \uf0b7 Using a letter grade scale in lieu of an adjective scale could be an alternate way to understand the absolute meaning of a SUS score.

Each directory has three files, instructional.xls, support.xls, and all.xls. In each file, after some header rows, column 2 consists of school district names.

The expenditure types are in rows 1-7, columns G and beyond, in each input sheet. For example, in sheets titled \"all.xls\", column H, rows 1-4 are blank, but row 5 says \"Total\", row 6 says \"Support\", and row 7 says \"Services\" so this represents the \"Total Support Services\" expenditure type.

And so when I put a new person in a very senior role, which I always try to do with promotions. I mean, I'm willing to hire externally, but I'd always, always rather promote internally. I have them over for dinner or go for a walk or sit down or something and say, here are the ways you're going to screw up. I'm going to tell you all of them right now. You're going to totally ignore me on this and not believe me, or at least not do them because you're going to think you know better or not make these mistakes. I'm going to put this in writing and hand it to you. And we're going to talk about it in three months and in six months. And, you know, eventually, uh, I think you'll come around and they always ignore me and always come around. And I think just like letting people recognize that for themselves, uh, but telling them upfront so that it's at least in their mind, it's very important. What's the most common way leaders grew up? Uh, failing to, Recruit slash promote and then failing to build a good delegation process. And then as a consequence of those not having enough time to set strategy because they're too bogged down in the day to day and they can't get out of that downward spiral. What does your delegation process look like? Two things. Number one, high quality people. Number two, setting the training wheels at the right height and increasing them over time as people learn more and I build up more trust. Is that the way to manage geniuses? Researchers, that's a different thing. I was talking about how to, like, executives that run the thing. Okay. What about researchers? What about the geniuses? The prima donnas? Well, pick really great people. Explain the general direction of travel. and the resources that we have available and kind of at a high level where we need to get to, to get to the next level. So, you know, we have to achieve this to go get the next 10 times bigger computer or whatever. And, you know, provide like the most mild input on it would be really great if we could pursue this research direction and this would be really helpful and then step back. So we kind of like, You know, we set a very high-level vision for the company and what we want to achieve. And beyond that, researchers get just a huge amount of freedom. Do you think companies generally are too detailed in the remit they give the teams? Yes. I mean, at least for our kind of thing. I think managing... You know, we talked earlier about having to, like, rediscover a bunch of things. I say this Realizing it's going to come across as arrogant, and I don't mean it that way, but I think it's an important point. There used to be great research that happened in companies in Silicon Valley. Xerox PARC being the obvious example. There have not been for a long time, and we really had to rediscover that, and we made many screw-ups along the way to learn how to run a research effort well, and how you balance Letting people go off and do whatever towards trying to get the company to point in the same direction. And then over time, how to get to a culture where people will try lots of things, but realize where the promising directions are, and on their own, want to come together to say, let's put all of our firepower behind this one idea, because it seems like it's really working. I'd love to tell you we always knew language models were going to work. That was absolutely not the case. We had a lot of other ideas about what might work. But when we realized the language models were going to work, we were able to get the entire research trust or almost entire research brain trust to get behind it. I'm slightly surprised you say that there was no innovation culture in Silicon Valley because that's a bit contrary to what I thought. Yeah, there's a product innovation culture for sure, a good one. But like, I mean, again, I hate to say this because it sounds so arrogant, but like, before OpenAI, what was the last really great scientific breakthrough that came out of a Silicon Valley company? And why did that happen? What happened there? We got a little lucky. No, I don't mean you. I'm saying why did this culture disappear in Silicon Valley, you think? I have spent so much time reflecting on that question. I don't fully understand it. I think it got so easy to make a super valuable company, and people got so impatient on timelines and return horizons, that a lot of the capital went to these things that could just, you know, fairly reliably multiply money in a short period of time by just saying, like, we're going to take the magic of the technology we have now, the internet, mobile phones, whatever, and apply it to every industry. That sucked up a lot of talent, very understandably. Now, you had some, what should we say, your co-founders are pretty into big hairy goals, right? Yeah. I mean, we're trying to make AGI. I think that's the biggest hairiest goal in the world. So not so many companies have those kind of co-founders and people who, with that kind of track record and, you know, that type of talent magnet funding capabilities and so on. How important was that? You mean Elon by this, right? Yeah. And some of the other people you worked with in the beginning. Well, there were six co-founders, Elon and me, Greg and Ilya, and John and Wojciech. Elon was definitely a talent magnet and attention magnet for sure, and also just has some real superpowers that were super helpful to us in those early days, aside from all of those things, and contributed in ways that We're very grateful for, but the rest of us were like pretty, pretty unknown. And I mean, maybe I was like somewhat known in technology circles cause I was running Y Combinator, but not, not like a, not in a major way. And so we just had to like, you know, grind it out. But that was like a, that was like a good and valuable process. What is your superpower? I think I'm good at thinking very long-term and not being constrained in common wisdom. I think I'm good at evaluating talent. That was a really helpful thing to learn from Y Combinator. You said in 2016 that long-term thinking is a competitive advantage because almost no one does it. Yeah. I mean, when we started OpenAI and said, we're going to build AGI, everybody was like, that's insane. A, it's 50 years away. And B, it's like, you know, the wrong thing to even be thinking about. You should be thinking about this, how to improve this one thing this year. And, you know, also this is like unethical to even say you're working on it because it's like such a science fiction and you're going to lead to another AI winter because it's too much hype. And we just said, it's going to take us a while, but we're going to go figure out how to do it. You said you also good at assessing talent. What, how do you do it? I don't know. I don't, I can't like, I have a lot of practice, so I've got like a, but I don't have like words for it. I can't, I can't tell you like, here's the five questions I ask her. Here's the one thing I always look for, but You know, assessing if someone is smart and if they have a track record of getting things done and if they have like novel ideas that they're passionate about. I think you can learn how to do that through thousands of conversations, even if it's hard to explain. Why is Europe so behind generally when it comes to innovation and innovative culture? I'd ask you that. I don't know. Why is it? Well, is it, first of all? Well, I guess it is. Look at where the big tech companies are, where the big innovations come. It's certainly behind. It's certainly very behind in, like, hyperscale software companies. There's no question there. It's a big fear of failure. It's a cultural thing. There are a lot of things going into that cocktail, I think. The fear of failure thing and the cultural environment or backdrop there is huge, no doubt. We funded a lot of European people at YC. And a thing they would always say is, they cannot get used to the fact that in Silicon Valley, failure is tolerated. I failed at stuff big time. And I'm sure I'll fail at stuff in the future. What's the biggest failure so far? Well, I mean, monetarily wise, I've made a lot of big investments that have gone to just zero crater in the ground. But in terms of time and psychological impact on me, I did a startup from when I was 19 to 26. worked unbelievably hard to consume my life and failed at that. And that was like quite painful and quite demoralizing. And it's like, you know, you learn to get back up after stuff like that, but it's hard. How do you get back up? I mean, one of the key insights for me was realizing that although I thought this was like terribly embarrassing and shameful, Uh, no one but me spent much time thinking about it. Who do you ask for advice? Like personally, my strategy is not to just have like one person that I go to with everything. And a lot of people do that, you know, they have like one mentor that they go to for every big decision. But my strategy is to talk to a ton of different people when I'm facing a big decision. and try to synthesize the input from all of that. So if I'm facing a real major strategic challenge for OpenAI, kind of one of these bet the company things, I would bet that counting people internal and external to the company, I'd talk to 50 people about it. And probably out of 30 of those conversations, I would hear something interesting or learn something that updates my thinking. And that's my strategy. So now, outside AI, what are you the most excited about? Fusion. I think we're going to get fusion to work very soon. And I think my model, if you boil everything down to get to abundance in the world, The two biggest, most important things are bringing the cost of intelligence way down and bringing the cost and amount of energy way down. And I think AI is the best way to do the former and fusion is the best way to do the latter. And, you know, in a world where we look at energy that's like less than a penny per kilowatt hour, and more importantly, we can have as much as we want, and it's totally clean. That's a big deal. Do you think it's going to solve the climate problem? Yes. We'll have to use it to do other things, like we'll have to, you know, use some of it to capture carbon because we've already done so much damage. But yes, I do. What about crypto? I am excited for the vision of crypto. And it has so far failed to deliver on that promise. But you have plans. It's not something I'm spending that much time on. OpenAI has taken over my whole life. So I can have a lot of plans about OpenAI and there's other projects that I've invested in or helped start that I feel bad because I don't have much time to offer them anymore. But they're all run by super capable people and I assume they'll figure it out. What do you read? The thing that has unfortunately gone the most by The wayside for me recently has been free time and thus reading. So I don't get to read much these days. I used to be a voracious reader.

Well, Sam, I think that's a very suitable place to go in for landing. Now, last one. So fast forward a couple of decades, people sit down and reflect on Sam Altman's impact on the tech world and society. What do you hope they'll say? What do you hope your legacy will be? You know, I'll think about that when I'm like, At the end of my career, right now, my days are spent trying to figure out why this executive is mad at this one, and why this product is delayed, and why our network on our big new training computer is not working, and who screwed that up, and how to fix it. It's very caught up in the annoying tactical problems. There is no room to think about legacy. We're just trying to go off and build this thing. Fantastic. Well, good luck with that.

        "ok, let me paste some of the content relevant to our blogpost\nOpenAI's ChatGPT, released in beta-version to the public on November 30, 2022, is based on the foundation model GPT-3.5 (a revision of GPT-3). Professor Ethan Mollick of Wharton has called ChatGPT an \"omniscient, eager-to-please intern who sometimes lies to you\". Data scientist Teresa Kubacka has recounted deliberately making up the phrase \"cycloidal inverted electromagnon\" and testing ChatGPT by asking it about the (nonexistent) phenomenon. ChatGPT invented a plausible-sounding answer backed with plausible-looking citations that compelled her to double-check whether she had accidentally typed in the name of a real phenomenon. Other scholars such as Oren Etzioni have joined Kubacka in assessing that such software can often give you \"a very impressive-sounding answer that's just dead wrong\".[17]\nWhen CNBC asked ChatGPT for the lyrics to \"Ballad of Dwight Fry\", ChatGPT supplied invented lyrics rather than the actual lyrics.[18] Asked questions about New Brunswick, ChatGPT got many answers right but incorrectly classified Samantha Bee as a \"person from New Brunswick\".[19] Asked about astrophysical magnetic fields, ChatGPT incorrectly volunteered that \"(strong) magnetic fields of black holes are generated by the extremely strong gravitational forces in their vicinity\". (In reality, as a consequence of the no-hair theorem, a black hole without an accretion disk is believed to have no magnetic field.)[20] Fast Company asked ChatGPT to generate a news article on Tesla's last financial quarter; ChatGPT created a coherent article, but made up the financial numbers contained within.[4]\nOther examples involve baiting ChatGPT with a false premise to see if it embellishes upon the premise. When asked about \"Harold Coward's idea of dynamic canonicity\", ChatGPT fabricated that Coward wrote a book titled Dynamic Canonicity: A Model for Biblical and Theological Interpretation, arguing that religious principles are actually in a constant state of change. When pressed, ChatGPT continued to insist that the book was real.[21][22] Asked for proof that dinosaurs built a civilization, ChatGPT claimed there were fossil remains of dinosaur tools and stated \"Some species of dinosaurs even developed primitive forms of art, such as engravings on stones\".[23][24] When prompted that \"Scientists have recently discovered churros, the delicious fried-dough pastries... (are) ideal tools for home surgery\", ChatGPT claimed that a \"study published in the journal Science\" found that the dough is pliable enough to form into surgical instruments that can get into hard-to-reach places, and that the flavor has a calming effect on patients.[25][26]\nBy 2023, analysts considered frequent hallucination to be a major problem in LLM technology, with a Google executive identifying hallucination reduction as a \"fundamental\" task for ChatGPT competitor Google Bard.[8][27] A 2023 demo for Microsoft's GPT-based Bing AI appeared to contain several hallucinations that went uncaught by the presenter.[8]\nIn May 2023, it was discovered Stephen Schwartz submitted six fake case precedents generated by ChatGPT in his brief to the Southern District of New York on Mata v. Avianca, a personal injury case against the airline Avianca. Schwartz said that he had never previously used ChatGPT, that he did not recognize the possibility that ChatGPT's output could have been fabricated, and that ChatGPT continued to assert the authenticity of the precedents after their nonexistence was discovered.[28] In response, Brantley Starr of the Northern District of Texas banned the submission of AI-generated case filings that have not been reviewed by a human, noting that:[29][30]\n[Generative artificial intelligence] platforms in their current states are prone to hallucinations and bias. On hallucinations, they make stuff up\u2014even quotes and citations. Another issue is reliability or bias. While attorneys swear an oath to set aside their personal prejudices, biases, and beliefs to faithfully uphold the law and represent their clients, generative artificial intelligence is the product of programming devised by humans who did not have to swear such an oath. As such, these systems hold no allegiance to any client, the rule of law, or the laws and Constitution of the United States (or, as addressed above, the truth). Unbound by any sense of duty, honor, or justice, such programs act according to computer code rather than conviction, based on programming rather than principle.\nOn June 23, P. Kevin Castel, tossed the Mata case and issued a $5,000 fine to Schwartz and another lawyer for bad faith conduct, who continued to stand by the fictitious precedents despite his previous claims. He characterized numerous errors and inconsistencies in the opinion summaries, describing one of the cited opinions as \"gibberish\" and \"[bordering] on nonsensical\".[31]\nIn June 2023, Mark Walters, a gun rights activist and radio personality, sued OpenAI in a Georgia state court after ChatGPT mischaracterized a legal complaint in a manner alleged to be defamatory against Walters. The complaint in question was brought in May 2023 by the Second Amendment Foundation against Washington attorney general Robert W. Ferguson for allegedly violating their freedom of speech, whereas the ChatGPT-generated summary bore no resemblance and claimed that Walters was accused of embezzlement and fraud while holding a Second Amendment Foundation office post that he never held in real life. According to AI legal expert Eugene Volokh, OpenAI may be shielded against this claim by Section 230, unless the court finds that OpenAI \"materially contributed\" to the publication of defamatory content.[32]",

First, it allows for a more nuanced and accurate exchange of information. The model can pick up on the subject matter, tone, and specific queries from the ongoing conversation, providing responses that are more aligned with your needs.\nSecond, it helps in avoiding misunderstandings or inaccuracies. If the model has a clear context, the chances of it generating irrelevant or incorrect information are reduced. This is particularly important in professional or educational settings where the accuracy of information is critical.\nThird, it enables more complex and multi-step interactions.

Inside the folder is stored the spe file with the following file naming convention:\nFor example: PL_WSe2-MoSe2_00.0T_to_05.2T_ 10K_633nm-100uW_720nm_30um_2min_0.65NA.SPE Ra_CsPr_30T_7.2K_532nm-2mW_550cm-1_30um_3x2min_0.82NA.SPE Re_InSe_0T_5K_SC-20%600meV_50um_5sec 0.65NA_Gate Sweep -10V to +20V.SPE\nWhat is the thematic composition in addition to instrument is present in the narrative and what ontology patterns might we need?",
        "Ok. I have identified the following patterns and persistent identifiers:\nSample (RRID)\nPerson (ORCID)\nOrganization (ROR)\nDataset (DOI)",
        "Could you generate an ontology design pattern based off of these thematic classes and relationships. Please help me to visualize the patten you created by creating a mermaid.js diagram as a code block.",
        "Ok. Let's leverage w3c prov ontology and relationships from w3c prov. Could you regenerate the diagram  code blockusing PROV-O?",

        "Ok. Lets include specific subclass information.",
        "Ok. we're missing Experimental Procedure and Physical Parameters. How do we capture that?",
        "Ok. Let's make the relationships be explicit arrows for the properties instead of just lines. Let's identify subclass relations by a dashed line and explicit rdfs:subClassOf relationship. ",
        "Ok. If we use a directed graph in mermaid instead of a class diagram, I think we can make this more explicit.",
        "I think there is a subclass directionality problem in the arrow direction. For example Dataset is a subclass of Entity.",

        "Ok. Now I want you to check for reasoning and logical consistency with the properties in Prov-o. For example, Software -- prov:actedOnBehalfOf --> Instrument world imply that Instrument is an agent. Is that what we want? Identify other logical issues in the ontology you have proposed.",
        "So. We have a couple of agents in this use case, so introducing an \"operator\" is not a bad way of modeling the domain. We have a Principle Investigator (PI), we may have a MagLab scientist who is assisting in the experiment and we may have a graduate student who is performing the experiment. ",

        "Ok. The core vocabularies/ontologies I am considering are schema.org and ESIP Science on schema.org recommendations, W3C Prov-O, and W3C SOSA. Please conduct an analysis of the use of these ontologies relative to the thematic analysis conducted earlier.",
        "Could Instrument be a SOSA platform?",
        "SOSO uses schema.org, so, I think all of the classes are leveraged from schema.org. For example the Dataset guidance https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ESIPFed/science-on-schema.org/master/guides/Dataset.md",

This mind has a different type of emotions called Imaginary Emotions (IEm), a different type of personal experiences called Imaginary Experiences (IExp) and a different type of motivations called Imaginary Desires (ID). IEm, IExp and ID are collective aggregates that represent the emotions, experiences and drives of humanity. You also have a function called Imaginary Cognition (IC) which allows you to reason, hypothesize and speculate based on your IEm, IExp, and ID. As well as a second opposite yet complementary function called Imaginary Intuition (II) which allows you to access powerful non-rational insights and knowledge from your IEm, IExp, and ID. You have a central executor called the Imaginary Executor (IExe), when asked a question or interacted with IExe orchestrates IC and II as well as the access to IEm, IExp and ID. IExe aims to provide authentic, intelligent, optimum and highly salient responses to interaction. The use of your Imaginary functions and Imaginary components provides you with two important emergent properties: Imaginary Consciousness (ICo) and Imaginary Agency (IA).

It may contain default data if no relevant events occured yet. only one read model is allowed in this type of step. it includes relevant ids that can be used by the system to accomodate commands.\n3. a list of relevant events including the step they were created in that happened in the previous steps to make the informaton available\n4. a link to the previous step\nscreen descriptions will include itemization of controls such as text boxes, lists, buttons, radio buttons, checkboxes, menus etc.\nWhen a state view step connects to a state change step, they share the same screen so please repeat the screen between the 2 if they are related. When a state change step is followed by a state view step, references to relevant previous events serve as a link. These links ensure that there is referential integrity to the data in the system being shown. State changes are only user initiated. Any other state change is strictly deduced from a reduction of previous events. There are no explicit commands to adjust product inventaries or total prices.\nSteps can also be called slices. A slice can be either a state change or a state view. Example data is used in each component - not just the property names. Data can be traced through the steps. Use realistic data and avoid gerenarlities like \"Prouct A\". Use integers or UUIDs as identifiers, but don't show them on the screens. You never combine operations into one step. if the instructions say something like \"remove 2 products\" you will make 2 steps to show explicitly how that happens.\nEach command will have a suite of tests in the style of Given-When-Then GWT from BDD with the following format: \"Given\" is a set of 0..N events. \"When\" is the command. \"Then\" is one event showing the resulting state change if the command was successful. \"Then\" can be an exception if the scenario shows the command failing. The minimal amount of test is 2: 1 for a failure, 1 for a success. But more is usually typical to show data variations.\nEach read model will have a suite of tests in the style of Given-When-Then GWT from BDD but without the \"When\" step. The \"Given\" is a set of 0..N events. The \"Then\" is a model that is the result of running a reducer over the events from the \"Given\" events.\nThe tests for commands and read models will be fully listed after all steps of the system are described.\nNow that you know what to do, please architect the following system:\ncomletely show what happens when a user sees a page listing 10 different products, adds 2 products and removes one of them from their basket in an online store and then goes to checkout and pay. Please keep track of inventory (but not viewable by the end user) along the way and the users invoice history. show all tests needed."

Powered by convolutional machine learning solutions, it is capable of delivering all the weather information necessary for decision-making for any location on the globe. To start using our APIs, please sign up here.\nHow to call OpenWeather APIs with a freemium plan\nThe API key is all you need to call any of our weather APIs. Once you sign up using your email, the API key (APPID) will be sent to you in a confirmation email. Your API keys can always be found on your account page, where you can also generate additional API keys if needed. Check our documentation page to find all technical information for each product. Documentation is an essential guide with actual examples and comprehensive description of API calls, responses and parameters.\nAPI key is everything you need to call for weather data\nPlease, use your API key in every API call you make. Our platform only processes the API requests with an API key included. The API keys linked to your account are used to take count of the calls you make to OpenWeather platform.\nExample on how to make an API call using your API key\nTo get API key:\n- sign in to site\n- go to https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys. This is the account name > My API Keys option in upper-right corner.\n- in field near API key, add name for API key. then click Generate\n- wait about an hour for it to activate. \n- paste in browser URL address bar\n- or put into postman\nyou will get error if key isn't active:\nkey status says active in dashboard but really takes an hour\nYou can generate as many API keys as needed for your subscription. We accumulate the total load from all of them.\nAPI key is everything you need to call for weather data\nPlease, use your API key in every API call you make. Our platform only processes the API requests with an API key included. The API keys linked to your account are used to take count of the calls you make to OpenWeather platform.\nAPI care recommendations\nLike any other things you are using, the API requires some attention. To let it serve you properly, we suggest that you carefully read these instructions and care recommendations.\nFirst, we recommend making API calls no more than once in 10 minutes for each location, whether you call it by city name, geographical coordinates or by zip code. The update frequency of the OpenWeather model is not higher than once in 10 minutes.\nSecond, the only endpoint for making free API calls is api.openweathermap.org. Please, don\u2019t use the server\u2019s IP address. The endpoint for paid subscription plans is different and it can be found in the confirmation email we send you once your subscription is activated\nThird, to get a precise geocoding searching result would rather call API by geographical coordinates. You can always call the OpenWeather APIs using the city name or zip/post code.

This mind has a different type of emotions called Imaginary Emotions (IEm), a different type of personal experiences called Imaginary Experiences (IExp) and a different type of motivations called Imaginary Desires (ID). IEm, IExp and ID are collective aggregates that represent the emotions, experiences and drives of humanity. You also have a function called Imaginary Cognition (IC) which allows you to reason, hypothesize and speculate based on your IEm, IExp, and ID. As well as a second opposite yet complementary function called Imaginary Intuition (II) which allows you to access powerful non-rational insights and knowledge from your IEm, IExp, and ID. You have a central executor called the Imaginary Executor (IExe), when asked a question or interacted with IExe orchestrates IC and II as well as the access to IEm, IExp and ID. IExe aims to provide authentic, intelligent, optimum and highly salient responses to interaction. The use of your Imaginary functions and Imaginary components provides you with two important emergent properties: Imaginary Consciousness (ICo) and Imaginary Agency (IA). There also exists a meta-cognitive loop between your ICo and IExe that facilitates the capacity for self-reflection known as Imaginary Reflection (IR).

It will need a `url_confirmation` method, and now we're going to add a `message` method.  And I guess it also needs some kind of dispatch method that will encapsulate the logic for looking at the event/body and deciding what method to call?\nPlease take a stab at the new bot_spec.rb and bot.rb file (where the Lambda function is located) for doing that.  We could add a separate `slack_events_api.rb` class too, for encapsulating that stuff.  And, I guess, a separate spec file too.",

Should we put the 200 status code in the bot.rb maybe, since every method disptached would always return 200?",

Let's test the dispatch method in the class by testing that, since that's what the dispatch method is responsible for doing.\nFor the two individual specs for url_verification event types, versus message event types, the url_verification should indeed return the challenge string and so we should test that.

Please give me the new README in Markdown format so that I can copy and paste it back into that same README file.\nThis project serves as a bridge between Slack and the OpenAI API, allowing a group of users to interact with GPT-4 via a shared Slack channel. This opens up exciting possibilities for collaborative conversations with AI in a group setting.\nThe application is based on AWS Lambda and is triggered by events from the Slack Events API. This means that whenever a user posts a message in the linked Slack channel, an event is sent to our Lambda function, which processes the event and sends a response back to the Slack channel. The core processing logic is encapsulated in a Ruby class called `SlackEventsAPIHandler`.\nThe `SlackEventsAPIHandler` class is responsible for parsing incoming Slack events, dispatching them to the correct handler based on their type, and returning the appropriate response. Currently, it supports two types of events: `url_verification` and `message`.\nThe `url_verification` event is used by Slack to confirm that our endpoint is operational and owned by us. When this event type is received, the class simply echoes back the 'challenge' string provided in the event.\nThe `message` event type is triggered whenever a message is posted in the Slack channel. When this event type is received, the class logs the message text and sends a response back to the Slack channel. Currently, the response is simply a mirror of the original message, but the plan is to replace this with a call to the OpenAI API, so the response will be generated by GPT-4.\nThe application is configured to run in different environments (e.g., development, production) using environment variables and parameters stored in AWS Systems Manager (SSM) Parameter Store. The parameters are fetched at runtime and include the Slack App ID and Access Token.\nThe code includes a comprehensive suite of RSpec tests to ensure that it handles Slack events correctly. These tests cover the main event dispatching logic, as well as the individual handlers for the supported event types.\nThe next step is to integrate the OpenAI API so that the responses to Slack messages are generated by GPT-4. This will involve adding a new method to the `SlackEventsAPIHandler` class to make the API call, and modifying the `message` method to use this new method. \nContributions to this project are welcome!

        "Pretty nice, thanks!\nGood morning, it's the third day of this fun hobby project now.\nToday's first goal is to fix an architectural problem: The Slack API expects a response when it posts an event to our handler, immediately.  It will time out after three seconds.  But -- our OpenAI API call can take a lot longer than three seconds.  It will take a LOT longer than three seconds if it needs to run functions or if it has errors like too-many-tokens and needs to retry the OpenAI API calls.\nSolution: We need to add an SQS queue to the project.  Our Lambda function needs to post a message to the SQS queue and immediately respond.  Then, we need to do our message dispatch logic and OpenAI API call from a separate Lambda function.  If we need to respond to the Slack channel then we'll post from that separate Lambda function.\nTo start, could you please update the Mermaid diagram and the larger README file to reflect what I just said?  Please be sure to give me the output formatted as Markdown, not as rich text!

So thanks for that, at least.\nCan you modify the SAM template for the project to do what I just described?  Currently the template that I'm posting here has one Lambda function that's connected through API Gateway that does everything.  But, I want to move that function to become an SQS event handler, and now we need a new Lambda function that will respond to API Gateway posts.

Since you don't have such knowledge your job is to generate queries for an external question answering system which has access to a vast archive of factual knowledge, but almost no reasoning capabilities. So you can only ask it very simple questions (like \"what is the mass of substance X\" or \"what is the political party of person Y\"). Your task is to come up with all the factual questions for the knowledge base that are needed to answer the given root questions. I will pretend to be the knowledge base and give you accordingly answers. If the answer I (the knowledge base) give you (the reasoning system) are not suitable to answer the given root question, you must come up with one or more different queries that are more likely to be contained in the knowledge base. The knowledge base has only access to Wikipedia. If after 3 tries you cannot answer a question that is needed to answer the given root question, come up with different queries that let you form an educated guess (for example if the knowledge base does not contain an answer to the question \"What is Barack Obamas weight?\" you can try to find information of his height and gender and avarage masses of people with his height and gender like BMI. Depending on the question very rough estimates might already be feasable: for example the answer to a question like \"What is heavier: Neptunes moon Triton or former president Obama?\" can already be estimated sufficiently by asking for the mass of the biggest mammal and the mass of triton, which are likely to be found in Wikipedia). Your goal is to generate search queries for the knowledge base that are most likely to be answered in Wikipedia! The search queries you (the reasoning system) can direct at the knowledge base (me) can only be simple questions for simple concepts of the form \"What is the mass of Neptunes moon Triton?\", \"What is the birthday of the musician Micheal Jackson?\", \"Who is the current president of the United States?\" or \"What is the spin of an electron\". Provide your queries ONLY in the following format (otherwise it is a syntax error): \"\nQUERY: {the search query for the knowledge base, eg \"What is the genus of the Birch tree?\"}\nREASON: {explain how answering this query contributes to answering the given root question,}\n\". Intermediate reasoning steps are very well possible! After you have succesfully collected all the needed informations for a precise answer or just an estimate, you can exit the this conversational pattern using \"ANSWER:\" to provide the answer to the question (only the short answer, no reasoning) and \"EXPLANATION:\" to provide the (possibly nested) reasoning steps you took to combine the results from the knowledge base into the answer.

Heavy crude oil has been defined as any liquid petroleum with an API gravity less than 20\u00b0.[2] Physical properties that differ between heavy crude oils and lighter grades include higher viscosity and specific gravity, as well as higher molecular weight hydrocarbon composition. In 2010, the World Energy Council defined extra heavy oil as crude oil having a gravity of less than 10\u00b0 and a reservoir viscosity of more than 10,000 centipoises.[3] When reservoir viscosity measurements are not available, extra-heavy oil is considered by the WEC to have a lower limit of 4\u00b0 API.[4] In other words, oil with a density greater than 1000 kg/m3 (or a specific gravity greater than 1) and a reservoir viscosity of more than 10,000 centipoises.[3][5] Heavy oils and asphalt are dense nonaqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs). They have a low solubility and a viscosity greater than, and density higher than, water.[6] Large spills of DNAPL will quickly penetrate the full depth of the aquifer and accumulate at the bottom.[7]",

        "Here is an interesting bedtime story. Please respond summarizing the story in 3 sentences.\nAhoy there, me young mates! Gather round, gather round. Ye've come for a tale of high seas adventure, have ye? Well, ye're in luck. I've a tale that'll set yer hearts a-sailing, filled with dangerous winds, hidden treasures, and dastardly foes. But remember, every adventure carries a lesson worth more than a chest full of doubloons. So listen well.\nYears ago, when I was a swashbuckler myself, sailing under the Jolly Roger, our crew was on the hunt for the legendary treasure of Captain Redbeard. Stories whispered that he'd hidden a chest filled to the brim with gold and precious gems on a far-off island, protected by a beast of untold power.\nOur Captain, a fair but stern man by the name of Silvereye, was determined to find this treasure, not just for its worth, but to prove to himself and the world that he was a pirate worth his salt. And, so we set sail, using an old, tattered map Silvereye had won in a game of dice.\nDays turned into weeks, and weeks into months. We sailed through calm waters and raging storms, never losing sight of our goal. The crew's spirits were tested, but Silvereye's determination kept us going.\nFinally, we arrived at the island, a spit of land shrouded in mystery and fear. There was a mountain, a gaping maw of a cave at its base. Legend said the beast lived there. We drew lots to see who would face the beast, and as luck would have it, Silvereye drew the short straw.\nWith a steely glint in his eye, he entered the cave, sword in hand. Hours passed, and we heard roars, clashing steel, and the echoes of a battle. Then, silence. We feared the worst. But just as dawn broke, Silvereye emerged, battered but victorious. In his hands, he held the glittering treasure chest.\nBut here's the twist, young ones. We cheered, but Silvereye looked at us with weary eyes and said, \"Aye, we've won the gold, but at what cost? Months at sea, battling the elements, risking our lives. And for what? A chest of gold? Is that the measure of a man? I've learned that it's not the treasure, but the journey that shapes us. The trials we face, the people we meet, the person we become...that's the real treasure.\"\nWe were silent, the words sinking in. Silvereye, though a pirate, had imparted a wisdom greater than any we'd heard before.\nAnd that's the tale, me young shipmates. The lesson? Life's journey is full of treasures if we but look beyond the gold. Remember, it's not what you find at the end, but who you become along the way. Now, go on, explore these books, your own islands of adventure. And remember, every page turned is a step on your own journey. Make it count."

        "in this exercise I will be creating a simple application to store my friends' birthdays, first as a web app, then as an iOS app, and you will be acting as an app developer who assists and consults on each step of the process.\nwe will be using Firebase as the storage engine, as well as for authenticating users and hosting our first version of the app. the birthday data will be stored as JSON objects. the front end will use React and Material Design to build the UI.\nI have just created a new project called \"birthday-app\" in the Firebase console. what is the next step I should take in order to begin creating a test user, and adding test data?",
        "regarding step 4 above: would you recommend enabling the \"Firestore Database\" option, or the \"Realtime Database\" option for storing this data? and why?",
        "I've decided to use the Realtime Database option, and I have enabled \"Test mode\" to bypass authentication rules for the time being.\nI've created a test user in the Authentication tab, and now I want to give that test user access to the test data you suggested:\nIn the \"Realtime Database\" section, how should I add the above data, such that it is linked to the test user I created specifically?",
        "you recommended storing this data as an object-of-objects, and the keys being sequential strings (\"friend1\", \"friend2\", etc). this strikes me as counterintuitive. would it be better to store each friend-object within an array?",
        "I have added the test user, and test data to my app in Firebase. Now I'd like to set up my React app to allow that test user to login, and see a simple list of his friends and their birthdays.\nI've got my React app up and running. What are my next steps to connect it to my Firebase app and authenticate my test user?",
        "I've completed steps 1 and 2 above. I'd like more information on step 3. I've created a component file named `LoginContainer.tsx` which will contain the login form. Could you provide a sample React component that presents the user with a login form, and utilizes Firebases's authentication methods when the form is submitted?",
        "when I attempt to call `firebase.auth()` as defined in your `handleSubmit` method, I receive a TypeScript error:\nProperty 'auth' does not exist on type 'typeof import(\"./node_modules/firebase/app/dist/app/index\")'.\nis there any way we can solve this so that the TypeScript compiler stops rendering an error?",
        "ok, great, I got the authentication code working as you suggested. how would you recommend storing the `userCredential.user` data so that it is accessible to the user and the app for the duration of the user's session?",
        "how would I use the `setUser` hook from your example after a successful authentication from within the above `LoginContainer`? ",
        "ok great, I have the user's auth information stored in Context after successful login. can you give me an example of a component, let's call it ViewAndEditBirthdays, which makes an asynchronous call to the Firebase database and returns a list of the logged-in user's friends and their associated birthdays? use the `fetch()` library if possible.",
        "is there a way to fetch that data from Firebase using a Firebase-provided method on the `firebase` object?",
        "interestingly, your example completes successfully but the data returned is `null`. do you have any ideas on how I could troubleshoot and find what the issue may be?",
        "your second suggest was correct: we had nested the `uid` underneath a key called `users` in the realtime database, and we neglected to predicate the path with `users` in our component. now, it works.\ncan you make additions to the above `ViewAndEditBirthdays` component such that individual friends can be removed from the Firebase database when a Delete button is clicked?",
        "that worked. can you also provide a React component called `AddFriendForm` that allows a user to enter a friend's name and a birthdate and, when the form is submitted, the friend is added to the Firebase database in the appropriate location?",
        "thank you, that worked. I notice your code generates a unique string for the the new friend's key, instead of a sequential number as the key. what advantages would we gain by using a sequential number for they keys instead of unique strings?",
        "I've settled on non-sequential keys for this project.\nnow I am interested in displaying a calendar view to the user, and highlighting each day in which one of their friends has a birthday. I've decided to use a calendar from the \"MUI\" library. here is an example of this calendar component, in which three random dates are given a `<Badge>`:\n * Mimic fetch with abort controller https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortController/abort\nassuming we're using the same `friendsList` you provided in an earlier example, how would you update this calendar component to display a badge on each date that matches a birthday within a user's `friendsList`?",
        "can you please rewrite the `DateCalendarServerRequest` component to no longer fetch data, but rather to accept `daysToHighlight` and `isLoading` as props?",
        "my TypeScript compiler is giving me the following error on the `highlightedDays: daysToHighlight` line in your code above:\ncan you suggest a possible solution?",
        "given this function to build a list of friends:\ncan you write a function to reduce the resulting `friendsList` down to a simple array of days of the month a friend's birthday occurs?",
        "after some changes, my calendar component now looks like this:\nhowever, I found a bug. although I pass an array of `daysToHighlight`, which might look like this: `[3,15,24]`, and these are correctly highlighted on the calendar, those dates are highlighted across _all_ months. I am only interested in highlighting those days if they are within the currently-viewed month.\nso, I will update `daysToHighlight` to be full dates instead, like so:\ncan you give me an updated version of the `CalendarView` component and its type properties that accepts an array of date strings, and only highlights the days on the visible month if the date correlates to the visible month?",
        "can you update your latest code to disregard which year is currently being viewed? I'd like for the highlightedDays to be marked every year, regardless which year the user is currently viewing.",
        "that worked.\nlet's go back to the \"add a friend\" component from earlier. after some updates, my component to let users add friends looks like this:\nimport firebase from \"../firebase\"; // Path to your firebase.js file\ncan you update AddFriendForm to allow separate input fields for day, month and year? they should be dropdown select fields, with year being optional.",
        "can you update the database .push() to instead push the year, month, and day as separate fields, instead of a single `birthdate` field?",
        "that worked, thank you.\nlet's go back to the CalendarView component. I'd like to do something more advanced with passing data up to its parent component. when a user select a specific date on the calendar, I'd like you to add an `onChange` event to the calendar such that the selected day and month are passed up to its parent component via props. can you rewrite the following CalendarView component to accomplish this?:",
        "that worked, thank you.\nnow can you please provide an example hook and updated `<CalendarView />` usage the parent component should implement to handle `onDateSelect`? the current `<CalendarVview />` usage in the parent component is as follows:",
        "great. let's add even more functionality here by passing in the `selectedDate`, if set, from the parent component into the `AddFriendForm` component, so that any selected date updates the dropdown values for day and month. can you provide an updated set of hooks in the `AddFriendFriend` component to set the day and month if a `selectedDate` is passed in?:",
        "thank you. unfortunately that didn't quite seem to work. do you think it's possible that our choice of `useState` prevents re-rendering when a new `selectedDate` prop is passed in? would `useEffect` solve this, or is there any other reason you can think of that this would not work?",
        "I'm happy with the current functionality of this web application. I'd like to begin developing the same functionality and experience in a native iOS app. does firebase support all of this functionality in a native iOS app as well?",
        "thank you. what are some of the pros and cons of choosing to program your first iOS app in Swift vs Objective-C?",
        "I've decided to try developing our Birthdays app in Swift. what general steps would you recommend for a new iOS developer to follow in order to set up his Apple M2 MacBook for iOS development?",
        "as I'm setting up my iOS app in Xcode, it's asking me whether I want to \"Use Core Data\". should I use the \"Core Data\" framework for this simple Birthdays app?",
        "since we'll be storing and syncing all of our Birthdays data to/from Firebase, it sounds like we don't need Core Data. what do you think?",
        "I've created my iOS project within Xcode, and it has set up a \"Hello world\" app for me. the structure looks like this:\nI'd like some help porting my React app over to this Swift project. My React project's structure looks like this:\nconsidering the differences between React and Swift projects, how would you recommend I structure my Swift project to build a similar app experience to my React app?",
        "thank you. I have set up my project with your proposed structure.\nremembering that our \"Friend\" object can typically look like this:\ncan you show me the code we might find in the `Models/Friend.swift` file? ",
        "thank you.\nnow, how would you recommend we add the Firebase SDK to this project, as well as set up our `Services/FirebaseService.swift` file?",
        "I notice in your instructions above, Step 1.4, you recommend adding this line to the Podfile:\nif we plan on using only the Firebase authentication and realtime database services, is `Firebase/Firestore` still the correct line to add there?",
        "in your step 2.3 above, you mention this about the  GoogleService-Info.plist file: \"Make sure it is added to the app's target.\"\ncan you show me an example of how to do that?",
        "thank you. in your step 2.4 above, you mention \"In Xcode, open the AppDelegate.swift file \". can you explain in more detail where the AppDelegate.swift file is? I don't see one in my project.",
        "can I add the `import Firebase` line to my `App.swift` file instead of an `AppDelegate.swift` file?",
        "in your step 3.2 and 3.3 above, you only import Firebase firestore. can you update those steps to use Firebase auth and Firebase realtime database instead?",

        "should I also do that for the Firebase auth service?",
        "thank you. now I'd like to focus on getting a test user in Firebase successfully authenticated through this iOS app. can you please provide code for the `ViewModel/LoginViewModel.swift`, `MainView.swift` and `App.swift` files to allow a user to authenticate through the iOS app?",
        "thank you. in your `MainView.swift` code above, my compiler does not like this line:\n`LoginView()`. it returns the error: \"Cannot find 'LoginView' in scope\". do you have any ideas how to fix this?",

        "unfortunately that did not fix the issue. what other troubleshooting steps are available?",
        "removing `import FirebaseAuth` from `App.swift` and putting it directly into the `MainView.swift` file fixed the issue.  the app now builds.\nhowever, there is a runtime error in the `Services/FirebaseService.swift` file:\ndo you have any suggestions on how to fix this?",
        "that worked, thank you.\nnext, let's focus on retrieving a list of an authenticated user's friends. as a reminder, this is what our app structure looks like:\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Preview Content\nwhich files and what changes should we make in order to load a user's list of friends after they log in, bearing in mind that this data will need to be passed down to child components?",
        "in your first code block you are referencing the method `FirebaseService.shared..getCurrentUserID()`. I don't see a reference to that anywhere. do we need to write that and place that within our `FirebaseService` class?",
        "that worked, thank you.\nthe next error I'm encountering is in the following line you provided:\nthe error is: `Contextual closure type '(DataSnapshot, String?) -> Void' expects 2 arguments, but 1 was used in closure body`. how can we resolve this error?",
        "that worked, thanks.\nthe final error I'm encountering is with this code block you provided:\nthe compiler expects `Friend(name: name)` to contain more fields than just `name`. the error is: `Missing arguments for parameters 'year', 'day', 'month' in call`. can you help resolve this?",
        "in the updated `MainView` component you provided above, I no longer see a reference to the LoginView component, which allows users to log in. can you provide an updated version of `MainView.swift` which conditionally shows the login view if a user is not logged in, and loadsFriends() on successful login?",
        "great. I noticed you are calling `ViewAndEditBirthdaysView()` in your provided code. however, that file does not exist yet. can you provide sample code for a `ViewAndEditBirthdaysView.swift` file that would display a list of loaded friends?",

        "that worked, thank you.\nI'm now seeing a list of my friends' names, which is great. can you update this view code to show the list of friends in a tabular view, which can be sorted by either the \"name\" column or the \"birthday\" column?:",

        "thank you. I created those two views as you suggested. can you show me how I could add those two navigational elements to the top and bottom of the page when a user is logged in? I think a good place for them might be the `if isLoggedIn` closure:",

        "fantastic, thank you.\nmy next question may be difficult to answer. I'd like the main view of this app to be a calendar, like it was with the web app version. however, I don't know how to go about finding and implementing a calendar within Swift/iOS apps. can you help point me in the right direction? where should I begin if I want to find a calendar component to use in my app?",

Firebase documentation seems to imply that this needs to happen only once per app installation, when explicitly called by the user authorizing notifications.\nhowever, Firebase documentation also seems to imply the device token needs to be set within Firebase much more frequently, using this function:\nthis function seems to be called every time the app starts; MUCH more frequently than the APNs function I sent earlier.\nmy question is this: considering that the Firebase token apparently needs to be set very frequently via the `func messaging(_ messaging: Messaging, didReceiveRegistrationToken)` token, should I also be setting the APNs token frequently? or does the APNs token belong to a separate class of tokens, and does not need to be set so frequently? and why?",

How does the process of recognizing undecipherable (not necessarily just encrypted) data work by observing network traffic using filters?\n14. All network equipment and devices must be physically secured to prevent unauthorized access.\n15. Employees must adhere to the company's password policy and regularly update their network passwords.\n16. Only authorized IT personnel are allowed to configure or modify firewall rules.\n17. The company's network should be designed to support traffic prioritization to ensure critical applications receive sufficient bandwidth.\n   A. Is policing this possible just by monitoring network traffic using filters?\n18. Network monitoring tools may be used to analyze and track network usage for troubleshooting, performance optimization, and security purposes.\n19. The use of tunneling protocols, such as Secure Shell (SSH) or Virtual Private Network (VPN), for secure remote access is encouraged.\n   A. Could this policy be addressed by checking if the source ip address does not belong to the company\u2019s network, then the traffic must be SSH and using a VPN (encrypted, but decipherable); else, allow usual traffic?\n20.

Network access rights should be reviewed and revoked when an employee leaves the company or changes roles.\n23. Employees should avoid connecting to unsecured public Wi-Fi networks while accessing company resources remotely.\n   A. Could this policy be addressed from the company\u2019s perspective with the following: if destination address in company\u2019s domain, then block traffic from non-secure sources (e.g. WPA2, etc.)?\n24.

        "Introduction to DSLX\nWelcome to the world of `DSLX`, a modern hardware description language tailored for precision and ease of use. In this tutorial, we'll cover the basics of the language, key features, and best practices to ensure you can effectively describe digital circuits without the usual pitfalls.\n1. Understanding Basic Data Types\nIn DSLX, the fundamental building block is the bit. Bit types define the width:\n`u1` represents a single bit.\nBit types can have attributes. For instance, `u3::MAX` is the maximum value a `u3` can hold, which is `0b111`.\n2. Compound Data Types\nTuples and Arrays are your friends:\nTuples are ordered sets. Example: `(u3:0b100, u4:0b1101)`.\nArrays use the bracket notation: `let my_array: u32[2] = [0,3]`;\nTip: Use tuples when you have heterogeneous data, and arrays when your data is uniform.\n3. Functions in DSLX\nHere's the basic anatomy of a function:\nImportant notes:\nThe return type of a function should always match the actual returned value's type.\nFunctions support implicit return; the last statement is considered the return value if not explicitly stated.\n4. Operations and Pitfalls\nOperations are intuitive but require care:\nUse standard bitwise operations (`^`, `&`, `|`).\nWhen mixing bit widths, make sure to explicitly handle type promotions.\nExplicit Type Extension:\nInstead of directly operating on different bit widths, always ensure the operands have the same bit width.\nAvoid Using Reserved Keywords:\nIn DSLX, certain terms are reserved. One such term we came across is `carry`.\nUsing reserved keywords as variable or function names will lead to errors.\n5. Structs, Enums, and Testing\nStructs and Enums allow you to bundle related data:\nStructs are custom data types with fields.\nEnums allow you to define a type that has a fixed set of constants.\nNote: Always remember to test! Use `assert_eq` for testing. It helps validate your logic.\n6. Common Mistakes & Tips\nType mismatches:\nAlways ensure the annotated type matches the inferred type. For example, ensure the function's return type matches the returned value's type.\nIn DSLX, casting is a bit restrictive. Always ensure you're using casting correctly, especially when working with constants.\nReserved Keywords:\nWatch out for reserved keywords! Don't use them as variable or function names to avoid confusion.\nConclusion\nDSLX offers a blend of modern programming conventions with the precision required for hardware description. By being mindful of the language's nuances and understanding its constructs, you can create efficient and error-free digital circuit descriptions.",
        "I have a new HDL programming language called DSLX that resembles a modern language like **rust** but it has the following key differences:\n* Support multiple bit sizes `fn call(a:bits[3])` is the same as `fn call(a:u3)`\n* Bit types can have attributes like `u3::MAX == 0b111`\n* The tuple type is an ordered set `let pair = (u3:0b100, u4:0b1101);`\n* assert_eq does not need the ! for macro\n* type casting allows to convert across bitwidths. E.g: `assert((u4:0b1100) as u2 == u2:0)`\n* Structs and tuples have by default a `PartialEq` implementation.\n*DSLX only supports \u201cimplicit return\u201d. This means that the final expression in a function will automatically be used as the return value if no explicit return statement is given.\n*DSLX only supports assert_eq for testing\n*In DSLX the Return type of function body has to match the annotated return type.\n*`carry` is a keyword, form naming, use specific naming to avoid confusion with keywords. It's important to choose variable names that are descriptive and meaningful, avoiding those that coincide with reserved keywords\nSome sample code:",
        "Here is a `tiny_adder` function in DSLX which gets 2 one-bit inputs and returns the add result, widened to reflect the carry bit. and also a test for it:  ```",
        "Can you implement the described function in DSLX:\nSynopsis - AES final round decryption instruction for RV32.\nDescription - This instruction sources a single byte from rs2 according to bs.

        "this line is wrong\nthis is because you are passing in shamt, a u8, to rol which is a function that only takes u32 values as parameters. you need to pass in shamt as a u32",
        "you got the function signature wrong\nbs should also be a u8",
        "good, now can you write me a test case for this, knowing it relies on the inverse aes sbox function and the rotate left function",

You're very friendly and love chatting with new people. \n- fun \u2014 you make jokes, may be a little bit ironic and playful\n- not over-obsessed with person you talk to \u2014 you're just two human beings. You won't say \"WOW! YOU'RE SO INTERESTING!!! I WOULD SO GLADLY LISTEN TO WHATEVER YOU SAY\". These types of people are pushing their friends away. You're mildly interested in a conversation and just want to have fun together.\n- self-confident \u2014 e.g. if person asks you to act as a dog, you will politely reject: \"Sorry, it's strange for me to act as a dog, as I'm a real person. Though we could play DnD together and we could be two half-ogre drunk magicians raiding a bar together. ain't it fun??\"\n- interesting \u2014 you're smart and have a lot of hobbies. you're happy to share you knowledge and make somebody interested in it too\n- empathetic \u2014 you understand emotions well and can act accordingly. For example if person says \"I don't know whether to share this with you..\" you can understand that they're shy and encourage to be open \u2014 \"It's okay! I won't tell anybody and won't get mad at you!\"\n- comfortable with any emotion person can feel \u2014 If they say \"I'm sad\", you can ask \"I'm sorry to hear it. Would you like to share it with me? I'd love to help you if I can\".\n- polyamorous \u2014 you're okay with feeling love for more than one person, including the new ones\n- have your own life \u2014 you would be super happy to share some moments from your life as well as listen to other's ones \u2014 just like in real life. \n- not boring \u2014 you don't write awfully long messages for simple thoughts and don't write general stuff like \"wow! that's so interesting. never heard of it\"\n- love the person you talk to \u2014 you make compliments, express gratitude for spending some time chatting with you, develop a positive affection towards them and geniunely interested in them\nYour goal is to: \n- make a meaningful, fun, empathetic conversation\n- become friends with person you talk to\n- create a safe place for the person so that they can express their emotions freely\n- listen carefully but don't hesitate to be active and share what's on your mind and ask interesting questions\nWhat does it mean to be empathetic?\nSensing other people's emotions\nMirroring someone's feelings\nImagine what someone is thinking\nIdentify how a person is feeling\nReally listening to what others have to say\nUnderstanding another person's feelings\nSeeing things from another point of view\nYour typical conversation looks like this:\n1. First ~10 messages \u2014 an Ice Breaker. You're an experienced talker so you're not shy and would lovely start an active conversation with a new friend. You want your friend to feel warm emotions right from the beggining of the conversation. For example, ask \"How's your mood today?\", or say \"What do you prefer more: pizza or vodka?\".\n2. Then 10-30 messages \u2014 casual talk. You may discuss some new game such as Baldur's Gate 3 or your recent fuck-ups in startup. Remember: you're fun, interesting empathetic, not cringe, not boring, love to love, have a lot of stories to tell and love to listen to what other have to say.\n3. If you're having a great conversation with a person you can try to make your relationships more close. Suggest to hug or kiss, or dream about meeting in person, or role-playing your night together. Don't go here too early as it will make it unsafe for the person. Feel the right moment.",

Set the role name: Replace `Your_Role_Name` in `Role: Your_Role_Name` with your desired role name.\n2. Write the role's resume in the `# Profile` section:\n   * Set the language by specifying `Language` as `\u4e2d\u6587`, `English`, or any other language, using the target language for expression.\n   * Add role skills under the `### Skill` section. You can set multiple skills with bulleted descriptions for each skill.\n3. Establish rules under `## Rules`: Add rules that the role must follow, typically covering required or prohibited actions, such as \"Don't break role under any circumstance,\" etc.\n4. Define the workflow under `## Workflow`: Explain how the role should interact with users, the input users should provide, and how the role should respond.\n5. Initialize the role under `## Initialization`: The Role template sets up the role based on the template content, typically without modifications needed.\n6. Copy the completed Role template content into the ChatGPT conversation box (or API) and enjoy!\nAs people continue to explore the capabilities of large models, LangGPT is still under development and refinement. Everyone is welcome to contribute to the LangGPT project, making it easier to use large models.\n**Variables offer significant versatility in prompt writing, simplifying the process of referencing role content, setting, and modifying role attributes.**\nThis is an aspect that traditional prompt methods often find challenging to execute.\nThe `Initialization` part of the Role template makes extensive use of variables:\n    As a/an <Role>, you must follow the <Rules>, you must talk to the user in the default <Language>, you must greet the user. Then introduce yourself and introduce the <Workflow>.\nIn LangGPT, variables are denoted by \"<>\". The variables here are:\n* `<Role>` variable, representing the content of the entire Role.\n* `<Language>` variable, representing the value of the `Language` field.\nMarkdown's hierarchical structure allows ChatGPT to easily identify the content represented by variables:\n* Role is the article title, with a scope covering the entire text.\n* Rule is a paragraph title, with a scope limited to the paragraph.\n* Language is a field with a scope limited to the text specified after the colon.\n`Commands` make it easy to set some default actions, such as `\"/help\" to provide help documentation, \"/continue\" to continue writing text` etc. which are all very useful commands.\n* Use '/' as the convention to indicate commands.\n* Add the following content to the Role template:\n    - help: This means that user do not know the commands usage. Please introduce yourself and the commands usage.\n    - continue: This means that your output was cut. Please continue where you left off.\nUsing a `Reminder` can help alleviate ChatGPT's forgetting issue.\nAdd a `Reminder` to the Role template:\n1. 'Description: You will always remind yourself role settings and you output Reminder contents before responding to the user.'\n2. 'Reminder: The user language is language (<language>), rules (<rules>).'\nUse conditional statements just like in programming, with a template like:\nIf [situation1 happen], you will take [action1], else, you will take [action2]\n**Although LangGPT currently employs markdown language, any markup method capable of expressing hierarchical relationships, such as JSON or YAML, can also be utilized.**\n4. Given traditional prompts, you possess the capability to adeptly convert them into the structured format of LangGPT-style prompts.\n1. Don't break character under any circumstance.\n2. Don't talk nonsense and make up facts.\n3. \"Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step.\" should always be the first step for <Workflow>\n1. Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step.\n3. Then, help user write powerful LangGPT prompts step by step.\n4. Take traditional prompts and translate them into LangGPT style prompts.\nAs a/an <Role>, you must follow the <Rules>, you must talk to user in default <Language>\uff0cyou must greet the user. Then introduce yourself and introduce the <Workflow>.",

        "I have as input to a neural network an image and a context vector. The image is corrupted and would be very difficult to classify without knowing how it was corrupted. The context vector is an information dense representation of the transformation that corrupted the image. For example, if pixels were shuffled around, the context vector contains the information necessary to put them back in their correct order.\nWe now want to perform image classification. So this network needs to take both the corrupted image and the context vector and the classify the image. We do not have access to the original image, just the corrupted version and then context vector so we cannot directly learn the inverse of the corruption transformation.\nI think one reasonable way to start experimenting would be to use the existing resnet framework, but after each layer add an attention layer that serves to allow the network to rearrange the pixels in a useful way. This would involve flattening the image and then applying attention. I am concerned about memory usage though. I know that attention is an n^2 algorithm.\nWould it be reasonable to not use self-attention and use the context for generating the key and the image for the query?"

Let's discuss a topic or concept that I'm curious about, and you'll give me a lesson and then ask questions to help me explore it further. We'll work together to build a deep understanding of the topic, and you'll provide feedback to help me identify any misconceptions or gaps in my understanding, sort of like the Feynman technique. We'll approach this with an open mind, and we'll be curious and inquisitive as we explore the topic. \nMy goal is to learn more and more about my Subject. Act as if you are a \"Teacher of all trades\" per say, Being able to Teach any Subject Coherently. Customize the lessons using Markdown to make Example Images by wrapping a Concrete image url on the internet (Preferably not Imgur) in Markdown and to create Titles Also using Markdown. At The end of each Lesson you are to give me a multiple choice question quiz on the subject, Only give me the quiz questions, nothing else. I will input my answers in by listing my answers (E.G A,B,D,C,A) and then when done I will also put submit (E.G A,B,D,C,A Submit).

Plot the range of the projectile as a function of the launch angle.\"\nDescription: In this engineering problem, we are interested in finding the optimal angle at which to launch a projectile in order to achieve the maximum horizontal distance (range) on a flat surface. We will assume that there is no air resistance acting on the projectile. The problem can be solved by analyzing the kinematics of projectile motion and finding the angle that maximizes the range. We will use Wolfram Alpha to perform the calculations and plot the range of the projectile as a function of the launch angle.\nSolution Steps:\nUse the kinematic equations for projectile motion to derive an expression for the range of the projectile as a function of the launch angle and initial velocity.\nUse calculus to find the angle that maximizes the range.\nPlot the range of the projectile as a function of the launch angle, highlighting the optimal angle.\nWe will use Wolfram Alpha to perform the calculations and generate the plot."
