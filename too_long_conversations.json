This is the repository for the 7B fine-tuned model, optimized for dialogue use cases and converted for the Hugging Face Transformers format. Links to other models can be found in the index at the bottom.\nModel Details\nNote: Use of this model is governed by the Meta license. In order to download the model weights and tokenizer, please visit the website and accept our License before requesting access here.\nMeta developed and publicly released the Llama 2 family of large language models (LLMs), a collection of pretrained and fine-tuned generative text models ranging in scale from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters. Our fine-tuned LLMs, called Llama-2-Chat, are optimized for dialogue use cases. Llama-2-Chat models outperform open-source chat models on most benchmarks we tested, and in our human evaluations for helpfulness and safety, are on par with some popular closed-source models like ChatGPT and PaLM.\nModel Developers Meta\nVariations Llama 2 comes in a range of parameter sizes \u2014 7B, 13B, and 70B \u2014 as well as pretrained and fine-tuned variations.\nInput Models input text only.\nOutput Models generate text only.\nModel Architecture Llama 2 is an auto-regressive language model that uses an optimized transformer architecture. The tuned versions use supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) to align to human preferences for helpfulness and safety.\nLlama 2\tA new mix of publicly available online data\t7B\t4k\t\u2717\t2.0T\t3.0 x 10-4\nLlama 2\tA new mix of publicly available online data\t13B\t4k\t\u2717\t2.0T\t3.0 x 10-4\nLlama 2\tA new mix of publicly available online data\t70B\t4k\t\u2714\t2.0T\t1.5 x 10-4\nLlama 2 family of models. Token counts refer to pretraining data only. All models are trained with a global batch-size of 4M tokens. Bigger models - 70B -- use Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) for improved inference scalability.\nModel Dates Llama 2 was trained between January 2023 and July 2023.\nStatus This is a static model trained on an offline dataset. Future versions of the tuned models will be released as we improve model safety with community feedback.\nLicense A custom commercial license is available at: https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama-downloads/\nResearch Paper \"Llama-2: Open Foundation and Fine-tuned Chat Models\"\nIntended Use\nIntended Use Cases Llama 2 is intended for commercial and research use in English. Tuned models are intended for assistant-like chat, whereas pretrained models can be adapted for a variety of natural language generation tasks.\nTo get the expected features and performance for the chat versions, a specific formatting needs to be followed, including the INST and <<SYS>> tags, BOS and EOS tokens, and the whitespaces and breaklines in between (we recommend calling strip() on inputs to avoid double-spaces). See our reference code in github for details: chat_completion.\nOut-of-scope Uses Use in any manner that violates applicable laws or regulations (including trade compliance laws).Use in languages other than English. Use in any other way that is prohibited by the Acceptable Use Policy and Licensing Agreement for Llama 2.\nHardware and Software\nTraining Factors We used custom training libraries, Meta's Research Super Cluster, and production clusters for pretraining. Fine-tuning, annotation, and evaluation were also performed on third-party cloud compute.\nCarbon Footprint Pretraining utilized a cumulative 3.3M GPU hours of computation on hardware of type A100-80GB (TDP of 350-400W). Estimated total emissions were 539 tCO2eq, 100% of which were offset by Meta\u2019s sustainability program.\nCO2 emissions during pretraining. Time: total GPU time required for training each model. Power Consumption: peak power capacity per GPU device for the GPUs used adjusted for power usage efficiency. 100% of the emissions are directly offset by Meta's sustainability program, and because we are openly releasing these models, the pretraining costs do not need to be incurred by others.\nTraining Data\nOverview Llama 2 was pretrained on 2 trillion tokens of data from publicly available sources. The fine-tuning data includes publicly available instruction datasets, as well as over one million new human-annotated examples. Neither the pretraining nor the fine-tuning datasets include Meta user data.\nData Freshness The pretraining data has a cutoff of September 2022, but some tuning data is more recent, up to July 2023.\nJust relpy normally. not sure how to navigate this", "wjhat is python -m venv llama-env\n ? the directory name that ho;lds the file s is Llama-2-7b-chat-hf", "do I absoutlely e NEED to do the virtual env? can i  just start with pip install transformers? normal answer no chapter ", "hi", "do I NEED the environemt or can i just do it straight awaay?", "ios this erro important o can i ignroe it ERROR: Could not install packages due to an OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'C:\\\\Users\\\\ykaufer\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Packages\\\\PythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.11_qbz5n2kfra8p0\\\\LocalCache\\\\local-packages\\\\Python311\\\\site-packages\\\\transformers\\\\models\\\\deprecated\\\\trajectory_transformer\\\\convert_trajectory_transformer_original_pytorch_checkpoint_to_pytorch.py'\nHINT: This error might have occurred since this system does not have Windows Long Path support enabled.

I want to avoid doing anything in the database regarding the magic link. So I encrypt a payload (includes the email it's intended for and it doesn't include an expiration currently, but it certainly could) and include that encrypted token in the email as a query parameter on the magic link. However, I just realized that I was hard-coding the salt which reduces the level of security and opens me up to brute force attacks.\nI'd still like to avoid touching the database for this, so I don't want to have to generate the salt and put it in the database. I considered putting the generated salt in the magic link query string as well. I realize this reduces the security a bit, but I'm wondering whether in a practical scenario if it's really that big of an issue and if I can address any holes that opens me up to.\nI'd love to hear your thoughts on this. Feel free to make a completely different suggestion I may not have considered or tell me that I really should just write something to the database for this process.\nI have also considered putting the salt in the user's session.\nI'm also adding a feature that allows the user to enter 5 random numbers into the app instead of clicking a link. Those numbers will be encrypted using the same method and that encrypted value will be stored in a cookie.\nHopefully that's enough context for you to make a recommendation on what I should do about the salt.", "Thanks. A few follow-ups:\n- For option 1, I hadn't considered this. Thwarting precomputed dictionary attacks is my primary objective, because it's the main vulnerability I'm trying to fix. Are there other vulnerabilities I should be concerned about? This option doesn't seem any more complicated to implement or maintain than option 2 and that feels safer. Is it?\n- For option 2, I think I prefer this option. Are there other considerations I should keep in mind?\n- For option 3, I could avoid writing to the database if I put the value of the salt in a cookie. The attacker would still have access to it if they submitted it themselves, but they wouldn't have access to the salt if they hacked into people's emails. However, this has the drawback of the user being unable to sign in from a different browser from the one that requested the token which I've already experienced in another app as something people complain about. So is the concern about someone hacking into people's emails all that valid in a practical scenario?\n- For option 4, Wouldn't another downside of the JWT token approach be that it is vulnerable to rainbow tables as well?\n- This sounds like a pretty good solution. Would it be reasonable to use a TOTP both as something I display for people to type as well as a query param in the magic link? Are TOTPs too long to expect a user to type? Keep in mind they may not be able to copy/paste because they may be using a different device to look at the email from the one they're typing into.", "Thanks. Please tell me more about TOTP solutions in a typical Node.js server setting.", "How hard would it be to implement TOPT without dependencies?", "To be clear, I'm fine using built-in Node.js libraries like the crypto module. Is this still pretty challenging?", "Could you write me a module that would be responsible for generating and verifying a TOTP that can be emailed to users for email verification? I want to use the notp module from npm. Please call out whether anything needs to be saved in a database and any environment variables.", "> Here, we're using the same key for all users, which is not secure.\nCould you elaborate on this point? I would like to avoid creating a table for this if possible. So I was thinking of generating a random key and setting that as an environment variable which every one of these uses. Why would that be a problem with this?", "Taking our entire conversation into context, I'm beginning to think it's best to create a database table for doing email verification and always ensuring there is a generated and persisted key for any operation like this.\nIf I were to change my preference of avoiding using the database to store the key, what would you recommend I do for email verification during onboarding assuming I want to keep the user experience of a magic link option as well as a short 5-6 digit number verification option.", "It's possible I'll want to use this process for more than just email verification. What issues do you foresee with me making this database table more generic? So instead of \"email\" we'd use more generic terms?", "Is the type field necessary? I think it would be safe to remove this. I think I would like to do that so I don't have to have an additional relational table. Can we remove that?\nI'm thinking instead of \"generation_time\" I'll use \"expirationTime\" which will make it easier for a background job to know whether it's safe to delete. Any issues with that?\nCould you write out the part of a prisma schema relevant to the model(s) necessary for this?", "Would it be reasonable for me to disassociate the verification model from the user? In the case of registration, I don't have a user yet. I'm thinking for registration I could just lookup the verification by the otp which would then allow me to create a new user by the identifier (which would be the email). Would doing this limit the usefulness of this model?", "For point 3, I could make the identifier be equal to the User ID. But that may be a bit ambiguous which makes me think bringing back the relational model for the `type` field would be useful. Which approach do you think strikes the best balance between complexity and flexibility?", "I'm using SQLite which doesn't support enum. Could you update the VerificationType to address this. Also, I don't think we need to include the User model anymore.\nAlso, is the term \"identifier\" the best option for what that really represents?", "Would that `@@unique` directive work if I used `upsert` when creating verification codes for which one of that type already exists?\nAlso, if I wanted to use a table for the `type` instead of a string, how would I do that?", "Nevermind. Let's leave the verification type as a string. I don't think it's enough of a benefit to have a separate model.", "What are the drawbacks of having more than one combination of verificationTarget and type?", "Ok, sounds good. I'm satisfied with the model and the architecture we've discussed. I'm considering whether I should include this model in my application database or if I should create a separate database for this. I'm using SQLite for all my databases and I already have a separate one for caching, so adding another one for verification doesn't feel like a big issue, particularly since the model is so simple so I wouldn't actually need prisma to manage it. Please argue both sides of this decision and make a recommendation.", "Good arguments. I think I'll keep it in the main database.\nCould you please write the module that uses prisma and manages creating and verifying TOTPs and handle edge cases where a second verification is created for the same type and target.", "Great. Thanks. A few bits of feedback:\n1. Please rewrite that to native ESM and TypeScript.\n2. The prisma client comes from `import { prisma } from '~/utils/db.server.ts'`\n3. Let's make function arguments objects that are destructured in the argument list position.\n4. Let's make the expiration time an argument\n5. Could you fill in the `generateSecretKey` function with an implementation?", "I'm thinking more about this. Going back to the original issue of hard coding the salt, can you describe what an adversary would have to do to exploit the vulnerability here? Perhaps I can do away with the salt entirely and simply encrypt it with a secret key. Also consider I could make it so the encrypted token is only valid for a short period. If I don't store the encrypted values in a database anywhere, how would my email verification method be practically susceptible to a rainbow table attack? Or would it be vulnerable to another kind of attack I'm not considering?\nWhat steps would an attacker have to follow to crack my encryption even with a shared salt? If it's impractical, is there another method of encryption I could use that would still allow me to use a shared secret key and not bother with a salt since I won't need to store the values in a database anyway?", "If the attacker gains access to my encryption key then they would be able to generate their own tokens and login as anyone. It's pretty well accepted that's bad news.\nFrom what I can tell, following the TOTP approach we've arrived at above would be the safest approach because even if the verifications table was breached, the attackers would have limited use for that as they would only be able to impersonate users whose verification had not yet expired (and with reasonably short expirations that would limit the number of vulnerable users drastically). Additionally, there's no secret key that could be lost, so they also wouldn't be able to generate their own valid tokens. An attacker would need to get write access to the database in which case we'd probably have even bigger problems anyway (so we'll apply good security practices around database access already). Am I missing something about the vulnerabilities around the TOTP? Is it a correct characterization to say that TOTP is similar in spirit to what I'm doing already except there's no salt and instead the encryption secret is randomly generated for every instance of verification and saved to the database and only valid before the expiration time?", "I want to clarify something around the idea of the \"shared secret\" and the \"server\" and \"client.\" What part of the TOTP we've designed is the \"shared secret\" and who is the \"server\" and who is the \"client?\"\nFrom what I can tell, the shared secret is the `secretKey` which is stored in the database. I don't believe that is shared with the client which is why I'm confused by the \"shared\" adjective here.\nAnd the \"server\" and \"client\" in my instance is just the node.js server. I don't think we want to send anything other than the `otp` in the email.", "Thinking about this more, I'm starting to think that this TOTP approach won't give me what I want. I was hoping to be able to let users verify their email address by typing a 5-6 digit number or clicking a link which includes that number in the query string. But it's possible (unlikely, but still possible) that two users could get the same number at the same time. I don't know how I'd prevent that or differentiate between those users.", "Ok, that's fine. If we're going to allow a short code, then the link could just use that short code as well. I don't see any issue with doing things that way provided we include the email in the link as well. So maybe the link could be something like: `https://example.com/verify?code=12345&email=me%40example.com`.", "I'm still feeling uncertain. It seems like I'm giving up the simplicity of having an environment variable which I need to keep secret and a couple very simple TS methods in favor of a database table and a more complex verification process. All because I'm vulnerable to the environment variable leaking. The only situation where the environment variable could leak is if someone gains access to my VM which would actually open me up to a lot worse problems either way anyway. I'm just starting to think this is unnecessary work to change. Please weigh the options.", "Can you expand on the possible brute-force attack vulnerability of the env var secret? Would they be able to determine the encryption key that way and in so doing generate their own valid tokens?\nAlso, if an attacker were able to gain access to my server environment, they would be able to access the SQLite database as well which means they could do much worse things than impersonate a user, so unless I'm missing something, that point is not a good argument against keeping things as they are.", "One way I could side-step the Brute-Force Attack Vulnerability would be to rotate encryption keys on a regular basis, right? If so, what's a reasonable frequency for that? I'm thinking that I could have a short grace period for old secrets as well to avoid issues with tokens generated moments before the switch. Would this resolve the brute-force attack vulnerability?\nIf so, are there any other vulnerabilities I'm not considering?", "Sounds like proper key rotation would involve even more complexity than TOTP we've discussed because it will require a database table for the secret and a background job for rotating keys. Instead of dealing with all that, just having a database table to store the short lived unique keys for individual users seems much more simple and even more secure. So the only scenario where a shared encryption key makes sense in this situation is where you decide you don't have a fear of people taking the time and resources to guess your encryption secret key. I don't want to take that gamble for what I'm building, so I think it's best to make the Verification table as we discussed.\nHowever, it looks like notp does not allow you to customize the algorithm used and it uses SHA1 which is no longer recommended due to security vulnerabilities. I'm considering just copy/paste/modifying that code into my codebase. Or is there another library I should use? I don't want to use `speakeasy` because it is quite old and has outstanding issues.", "I just noticed the prisma model you generated has the otp as unique. I don't think this is necessarily correct.

Will you start with all zeros, random numbers, or some other heuristic?\nExploration vs Exploitation: Decide on a strategy for balancing exploration and exploitation (e.g., \u03b5-greedy).\nCoding\nModular Code: Write modular, well-commented code. This makes it easier to debug and extend later.\nUnit Testing: Write unit tests for smaller components before integrating them. This will save debugging time.\nVersion Control: Use version control (like Git) to keep track of changes and to be able to revert to earlier versions if needed.\nDebugging and Optimization\nLogging: Implement logging to track the agent's decisions, Q-value updates, and rewards. This will help in debugging.\nPerformance Metrics: Decide on metrics to evaluate the performance of your Q-Learning agent (e.g., win rate, average reward).\nOptimization: Once the basic version is working, look for optimization opportunities in terms of code efficiency and algorithmic performance.", "can you put all this in a markdown code block:\nUnderstanding the Algorithm: Q-Learning\nBasic Concepts\nQ-Value: Represents the quality of an action taken from a particular state.\nState: A configuration of the Tic-Tac-Toe board.\nAction: Placing a 'X' or 'O' in an empty cell.\nReward: Numerical value received after performing an action. In Tic-Tac-Toe, this could be +1 for a win, -1 for a loss, and 0 otherwise.\nPolicy: A strategy that the agent employs to determine the next action based on the current state.\nEquation\nThe Q-value is updated using the equation:\nmax\nmax\ns = current state\na = action taken\nr = reward received\n\u03b1 = learning rate\n\u03b3 = discount factor\nDifferences from Value Iteration\nOnline Learning: Unlike Value Iteration, which is model-based and requires knowledge of all possible states beforehand, Q-Learning is model-free and learns by interacting with the environment.\nExploration-Exploitation: Q-Learning often uses strategies like \u03b5-greedy to balance exploration and exploitation, which is not a concern in Value Iteration.\nDesign and Architecture\nIdentify Components\nState Representation: You can reuse the state representation from your Value Iteration code.\nAction Selection: Implement \u03b5-greedy or another strategy for action selection.\nQ-Value Updates: Code to update the Q-values based on the equation above.\nReuse Code\nState representation, reward structure, and game termination checks can be reused from your Value Iteration code.\nPseudocode\npython\nCopy code\nInitialize Q-values to zeros or small random numbers\nfor each episode:\nData Structures\nA dictionary can be used to store Q-values, where the key is a tuple (state, action).\nInitialize to zeros or small random numbers.\nExploration vs Exploitation\nImplement \u03b5-greedy strategy for action selection.\nCoding, Debugging, and Optimization\nFollow the modular coding practices, unit testing, version control, logging, and performance metrics as you've outlined.", "so wont need a graph?", "but how will it know how to make a move if possible next actions aren't in a state graph for it to explore?", "so if i had: 1X 2 3O 4X 5 6 7O 8 9 representing the board state. qlearning will then choose a random legal move from here?", "so it will need multiple runs to fully update its table?", "this is my outline of a class:\nanalyse it, then we can discuss the design decisions.", "", "ok let's zoom out for now.\nwe have a class and the basic skeleton for the method structure.\nif we follow good development practices, what should we do from here?\nunderstand more about q-learning in general, think about how we will iteratively test...?\ni'm a bit lost from here.", "put all this in a markdown code block:\nHere's a roadmap that aligns with good development practices:\nPhase 1: Research and Understanding\nUnderstand Q-Learning: Before diving into coding, make sure you understand the Q-Learning algorithm, its equations, and how it differs from Value Iteration. This will help you understand what you're coding.\nStudy Similar Implementations: Look at existing Q-Learning implementations, especially those related to Tic-Tac-Toe or similar games. This can give you insights into how to structure your code.\nPhase 2: Design and Planning\nIdentify Components: You've already done this by outlining your class and methods. Make sure you understand what each method will do.\nPseudocode: Write pseudocode for the main algorithm and its sub-components. This will serve as your blueprint while coding.\nData Structures: Decide on the data structures you'll use to store the Q-values, states, and actions.\nInitialization: Plan how you'll initialize your Q-values. Will you start with all zeros, random numbers, or some other heuristic?\nExploration vs Exploitation: Decide on a strategy for balancing exploration and exploitation (e.g., \u03b5-greedy).\nUnit Tests: Write unit tests for the smaller components. This will save you debugging time later.\nVersion Control: If not already doing so, use a version control system like Git to manage your code.\nPhase 4: Implementation\nStart Small: Implement and test the smallest components first. For example, you might start with initializeQValues and chooseAction.\nIterative Testing: After implementing a component, test it. Don't wait to write all the code before you start testing.\nLogging: Implement logging to track the agent's decisions, Q-value updates, and rewards. This will help in debugging.\nPhase 5: Debugging and Optimization\nDebug: Use your logs and unit tests to debug the code.\nOptimization: Once the basic version is working, look for optimization opportunities in terms of code efficiency and algorithmic performance.\nPhase 6: Evaluation and Iteration\nPerformance Metrics: Decide on metrics to evaluate the performance of your Q-Learning agent (e.g., win rate, average reward).\nIterate: Based on performance and any bugs, iterate through Phases 4-6.\nPhase 7: Documentation and Cleanup\nComments and Documentation: Make sure your code is well-commented and, if possible, provide external documentation.\nCode Review: If possible, have someone else review your code.\nBy following this roadmap, you'll have a structured approach to developing your Q-Learning algorithm, which should make the process more manageable and efficient", "how many q-value will i have?", "might not be needed?", "i want to dive in an start coding chooseAction().\nbut i need to control myself. let's think step by step.\ni have these classes on hand if i need them to help me:\nimport itertools\nlet's think step by step about writing pseudo-code for chooseAction()", "can you debug this:", "how was the output?\nevery state action is the same.", "should this be adding all possible actions to the self.Qvalues?\nit's only creating one  new state when there's possibly 4 different moves", "ok. i'm still in value iteration mode. lol. thinking all the state must be populated in the beginning.", "maybe we should talk about the observerReward() method.\nis this the next logical step?", "i'm a bit confused. where will i call observeReward? and also why does it take current state?", "how can i test observeReward without implementing updateQvalues?", "start off with pseudo-code. then we can think about implementation and testing.", "this is causing an error.\ncan it be fixed with this:", "what are reasonable value for the rates and discfactor?", "Current player: X\nX wins\nUpdated Q value: 0.5\nGame over\nthe final state is not in the self.Qvalues?\nis this a problem?", "this is my output:\nO wins\nGame over\nhere is the class:\nimport random\nwhat should we think about implementing next.\nlet's think step by step and modify as little as possible , then test.", "yep. i added them. where do i call updatePolicy() ?", "there is no such function self.possibleActions()\nwhat is the point of this call.\nmaybe i can fix it?", "ok this is the output:\nGame over\nGame over\nwe are getting different values. so this mean things are changing.\nshould we have a  look at the policy now?\nwhat would we be looking for?
